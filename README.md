# completion-meter

## Our goal for now:
- Collect 50+ speeches on the Human behaviour
- Preprocess and chunk each speech
- Extract keywords, noun phrases and entities
- Track discovery rate of these units over time
- Build collector’s curve for each speech and average
- Compare new speech’s curve to estimate completion

That will complete first part of our approach, the collector's graph
