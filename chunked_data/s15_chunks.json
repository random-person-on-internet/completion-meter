Whether you're a psychologist, coach, educator, or simply someone interested in hacking your own behavioral patterns, we all share one central curiosity: Why do we do what we do, day after day \u2014 and how can we change it? Today, we\u2019re diving deep into the architecture of habit. Not just how habits form \u2014 but how",

At its core, a habit is a behavior repeated enough times that it becomes automatic \u2014 triggered by cues in our environment, and carried out with little conscious thought. The classic loop, as many of you know, is cue \u2192 routine \u2192 reward, a model popularized by Charles Duhigg, but rooted in decades of behavioral psychology. But the",
