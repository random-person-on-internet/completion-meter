Like, I was reading this article on emotional intelligence the other day, and it kind of blew my mind how much being aware of your own feelings and others\u2019 can totally change interactions. Oh yeah, emotional intelligence is fascinating. I think people tend to underestimate it because it\u2019s not as flashy as IQ or skills on a resume. But honestly, it\u2019s",
