It\u2019s a pleasure to be here today to explore a topic that touches every part of our lives\u2014human behavior and decision making. Every day, we make countless choices, some trivial like what to have for breakfast, others life-changing like whom to trust or what career to pursue. Yet, despite their importance, many of these decisions unfold beneath our conscious awareness, influenced by hidden forces inside and around",

By understanding these, we gain clearer insight into our own minds, improving our decision-making abilities and ultimately leading more fulfilling lives. Theme 1: Emotional Intelligence \u2013 The Compass of Our Inner World First, let\u2019s talk about emotional intelligence. Often abbreviated as EQ, emotional intelligence is our ability to recognize, understand, and manage not only our own emotions",

Now, if you lack emotional awareness, you might escalate that feeling, perhaps even shouting or retaliating in some way. But if you possess high emotional intelligence, you recognize that anger quickly, understand it as a natural reaction, and choose to respond calmly\u2014maybe by taking a deep breath or turning on some soothing music.

    "text": "Goleman, a pioneer in this field, argues that emotional intelligence often predicts success better than traditional IQ. Why? Because our emotions deeply influence our decisions. When unmanaged, they can cloud judgment, but when harnessed, they provide valuable information about our values, needs, and environment. To put this in a real-world context, consider a manager at work. An emotionally intelligent manager notices subtle cues\u2014an employee\u2019s hesitation, tone of voice, or body language\u2014and adjusts their approach accordingly. This sensitivity helps build trust,",

Our brains face an enormous amount of information daily. To cope, we use heuristics\u2014rules of thumb\u2014that speed up decision making. While efficient, these shortcuts can distort reality. For instance, take the confirmation bias. This is our tendency to seek out information that supports what we already",
