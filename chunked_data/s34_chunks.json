It got me thinking about how much of what we do is actually shaped by our environment versus our own choices. What\u2019s your take on that? Oh, hey Emma! That\u2019s a huge question. Honestly, I think it\u2019s a mix of both, but the environment probably plays a bigger role than most people realize. Like, social conditioning\u2014our upbringing, culture, even the people we hang out with\u2014all that subtly guides",

Like, if you\u2019re aware of your emotions and others\u2019 feelings, you might choose to act differently than what your environment pushes on you. Yeah, emotional intelligence is huge. I think it\u2019s almost like a toolkit that helps us navigate the social world more consciously. But I wonder\u2014how much can emotional intelligence actually change behaviour if",

Hmm, that\u2019s a good point. Awareness alone probably isn\u2019t enough, especially if the conditioning is deeply ingrained. It might take a lot of effort, maybe therapy or supportive relationships, to really rewire those patterns.
