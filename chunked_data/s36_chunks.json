It\u2019s fascinating how much of what we do is influenced by things we\u2019re barely aware of\u2014like emotional intelligence, or how society shapes us. What got you thinking about that?

Emotional intelligence, or EQ, is like this invisible skill set we all have, but most people don\u2019t really cultivate.
