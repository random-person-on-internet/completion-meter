    "text": "\"The Puzzle of Human Behavior: Why We Do What We Do\" Good evening, everyone. Let me ask you something simple\u2014but also incredibly complicated. Why do people do what they do? Why does a stranger stop to help you pick up your groceries when your bag rips on the sidewalk... while another just walks past, eyes glued to their phone? Why does a child lie about breaking a vase\u2014then cry about it ten minutes later? Why do we sabotage relationships we",

It's unpredictable, fascinating, and sometimes heartbreaking. And no matter how advanced we get\u2014no matter how many books we write, or algorithms we code\u2014there's something deeply untameable about the way we behave. Tonight, I want to explore that.

Small things would set him off\u2014someone taking too long in line, a friend canceling plans, even a slow internet connection. He wasn\u2019t cruel, but he was... on edge. Defensive.

You see, what looked like anger on the surface\u2014was really anxiety underneath. What looked like impatience was actually fear of being forgotten, abandoned. His behavior wasn\u2019t about what was happening now\u2014it was about things that happened years ago, things he\u2019d never really healed from.
