    "text": "\"The Beautiful Mess of Human Behavior\" Good morning everyone. Let me start with a simple question\u2014have you ever watched someone walk into a glass door? You know it\u2019s wrong to laugh\u2026 but you laugh anyway. Why? Because, well, we\u2019re human. And being human means being this wonderfully weird cocktail of intelligence, instinct, compassion, contradiction, and chaos. We are capable of sending spacecrafts billions of miles into space\u2014and still, half of us can\u2019t find our car keys in the morning. Today,",

My goal is simple: to help you see that in understanding human behavior\u2014our own and each other\u2019s\u2014we tap into something powerful. Something that can transform not just how we see the world, but what we believe is possible. So here\u2019s my thesis: Human behavior may be complex, inconsistent, even frustrating\u2014but it is",

That tension\u2014between our primal instincts and our modern environments\u2014is where a lot of our behavior emerges. Here\u2019s a story I love.
