We\u2019re here today at the intersection of two deeply human questions: \u201cWho am I?\u201d and \u201cWhy am I like this?\u201d And whether you\u2019re a clinician, a coach, or simply someone on a path of self-discovery, you\u2019ve probably found yourself tracing the lines of adulthood back to the origins of childhood.
