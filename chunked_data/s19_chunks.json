We live in a world that is more connected than ever\u2014and paradoxically, more divided. We can reach across the globe with a click, yet many of us feel isolated, unheard, or misunderstood. I believe that one of the most underutilized tools for healing this disconnect is also one of the most inherently human: empathy. Empathy is more than just",

While IQ might predict your ability to solve puzzles, EQ predicts your ability to navigate people, which is arguably more important in our daily lives. Empathy is one of the five pillars of EQ. It allows us to recognize, understand, and respond to the emotions of others. But here\u2019s the key: there are different kinds of empathy.

Research shows that infants as young as six months can show empathetic behavior\u2014like becoming distressed when they hear another baby cry.
