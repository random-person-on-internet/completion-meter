It\u2019s a real pleasure to be here today, discussing a topic that touches every aspect of our lives: decision making. Whether we realize it or not, every day we make countless decisions\u2014some small, like what to eat for breakfast, and others monumental, like choosing a career path or deciding to start a family. But have you ever stopped to think about how you make those decisions?",

Today, I want to take you on a journey into the fascinating world of decision making, through the lenses of emotional intelligence, social conditioning, and cognitive bias. By understanding these forces, we can better navigate our own mental maze and make decisions that truly serve us. Theme 1: Emotional Intelligence \u2014 The Heart in the",

Emotional intelligence, or EQ, is our ability to recognize, understand, and manage not only our own emotions but also those of others. When it comes to decision making, this skill is critical. Imagine you\u2019re about to give a major presentation. You feel the familiar flutter of anxiety, the pit in your stomach. A low EQ response might push you into panic or avoidance, leading you to procrastinate",

Let\u2019s channel this energy into focus.\u201d This emotional awareness can lead to more thoughtful and effective decisions. Research supports this. Studies show that people with higher emotional intelligence tend to make better decisions, especially under pressure. They can separate emotional impulses from rational thought, allowing for a balanced approach. They\u2019re also better at",

A common example is in relationships: deciding whether to confront a friend or partner about a conflict. High EQ helps you pick the right time, tone, and words, increasing the likelihood of a positive outcome. Without it, decisions are often reactive and short-sighted.

For instance, consider how societal expectations influence career decisions. A young person might love art but choose engineering because their family or culture values financial stability over creative expression. This conditioning creates an invisible hand steering decisions, often without conscious awareness.

Theme 3: Cognitive Bias \u2014 The Mind\u2019s Shortcuts and Pitfalls Finally, let\u2019s delve into cognitive bias, the mental shortcuts our brain takes to simplify complex decisions.

Another well-known bias is the availability heuristic: we judge the probability of events based on how easily examples come to mind.

Cognitive biases are tricky because they feel natural and often go unnoticed.",
