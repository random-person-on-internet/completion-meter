It\u2019s a pleasure to be here with such a thoughtful and curious audience\u2014people who understand that one of the greatest journeys we can undertake is the one inward, toward understanding human behavior: not just what we do, but why we do it. Whether you're here as a psychologist, a coach, a student, or simply someone trying to understand themselves or others a little better, you\u2019re engaging with one of",

And understanding these patterns is the key to both personal growth and social harmony. Today, I want to focus on three core aspects of human behavior: emotional intelligence, social conditioning, and cognitive bias. These aren\u2019t just academic ideas\u2014they\u2019re forces we encounter every single day, often without realizing it. So let\u2019s pull back the",

It\u2019s become a bit of a buzzword in recent years, but it deserves that spotlight. At its core, emotional intelligence is our ability to recognize, understand, and manage both our own emotions and the emotions of others. Now, this isn\u2019t just about being \"nice\" or \"empathetic\"\u2014though those are part of it. Emotional intelligence includes four main domains:",

Self-awareness is knowing when your engine light is on\u2014recognizing your emotional state. Self-regulation is your ability to steer calmly even when someone cuts you off. Social awareness is reading the traffic around you, understanding how other drivers are reacting. And relationship management? That\u2019s how you navigate all of that without causing a pile-up.

From the moment we\u2019re born, we\u2019re being trained\u2014by our families, cultures, schools, media\u2014on how to think, what to value, even what\u2019s acceptable to feel.

He might suppress grief, fear, or even empathy, not because those feelings aren\u2019t there, but because the system he grew up in told him they weren\u2019t allowed.

Confirmation bias: the tendency to favor information that confirms what we already believe. This is why two people can watch the same news story and come away with completely different interpretations.
