    "text": "Why We Do What We Do: Understanding Human Behaviour from the Inside Out Good morning everyone, It\u2019s a real pleasure to be here with you today. Whether you\u2019re a psychologist, a coach, a student of human nature, or simply someone trying to better understand yourself and others \u2014 you\u2019re in the right place. Because today, we're going to take a deep dive into what drives human behaviour. Not in a vague, philosophical way \u2014 but grounded in psychology, neuroscience, and",

It\u2019s a question that haunts every parent, every leader, every teacher \u2014 and, frankly, every one of us who\u2019s ever made a New Year\u2019s resolution and broken it by February. Why do we act against our own interests? Why do we repeat the same patterns? Why do we sometimes know better, but don\u2019t do better? To begin",

Emotional Intelligence: The Invisible Driver Let\u2019s start with emotional intelligence \u2014 or as I like to call it, the operating system we didn\u2019t know we needed an update for. Emotional intelligence, or EQ, is our ability to recognize, understand, and manage our own emotions \u2014 and to recognize, understand, and influence the emotions of others.

Take the amygdala, the almond-shaped structure in our brain\u2019s limbic system. It\u2019s designed to detect threats \u2014 real or imagined \u2014 and trigger fight, flight, or freeze responses.

Social Conditioning: The Scripts We Didn\u2019t Write Now let\u2019s talk about social conditioning \u2014 the invisible scripts we follow because we were never told we could rewrite them. From the moment we\u2019re born, we\u2019re absorbing cues from the world around us \u2014 from our families, cultures, media, religion, and peers.

One of the most famous examples of this is the \u201cStanford Prison Experiment.\u201d In 1971, psychologist Philip Zimbardo put college students in a simulated prison, randomly assigning them the roles of guards and prisoners.
