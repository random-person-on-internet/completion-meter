It\u2019s an honor to be here among so many passionate minds\u2014people who understand that psychology isn\u2019t just a theoretical field, but a toolkit for real change. Today, I want to talk about something deceptively simple but profoundly powerful: habit formation. Why do we keep checking our phones every few minutes? Why do some people bounce out of bed for",

At the core of all these questions lies the science of habit. Habits are the invisible architecture of our daily lives. They account for nearly 40% of our actions each day, according to a Duke University study. That means nearly half of what we do isn\u2019t the result of conscious decisions\u2014but automatic routines. Understanding how",

Today, I\u2019ll walk us through three key pillars of habit formation: emotional intelligence, social conditioning, and cognitive bias\u2014and how each plays a vital role in shaping, reinforcing, or undermining the habits that make us who we are.

Our feelings\u2014especially unconscious ones\u2014are the compass that guides how we form and cling to habits. Take the habit of stress-eating. The cue might be a tough meeting. The routine? A cookie. The reward? A fleeting sense of relief. But what sustains this habit isn\u2019t hunger or even craving\u2014it\u2019s emotional regulation, or rather, the lack of it.

Habits aren\u2019t formed in isolation. We\u2019re deeply social creatures, and our behaviors often mirror those around us\u2014without us even noticing.
