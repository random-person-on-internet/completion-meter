It got me thinking\u2014how \u201cfree\u201d are our choices, really? Oh, totally! I mean, on the surface, we like to think we\u2019re these rational beings weighing pros and cons logically. But honestly, emotions and all these subconscious filters shape so much of what we do. Have you heard of emotional intelligence? Yeah,",
