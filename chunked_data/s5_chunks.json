    "text": "\"The Mirror We Walk Around With\" Good evening everyone, Let me start with a question. Have you ever looked at someone\u2014maybe in a caf\u00e9, on a street corner, or across the aisle in a grocery store\u2014and thought, \u201cWhat are they going through?\u201d Not what they do. Not who they love or what they buy or how they dress. But what storms are silently raging behind their eyes? Human behavior. That\u2019s our topic today. Three simple syllables that contain the most",

I stumble, I learn, I observe. And the more I observe, the more I realize something deeply moving: Every action\u2014every smile, every silence, every outburst\u2014is a story in disguise.",
