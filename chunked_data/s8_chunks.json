It\u2019s a real pleasure to be here today at a conference that brings together people who are genuinely curious about the human mind and how we can better understand ourselves\u2014and each other. Now, let\u2019s take a moment to consider something simple, yet profound: Every decision you\u2019ve ever made, every interaction you\u2019ve had, every relationship you\u2019ve built\u2014has been shaped by your behavior.

Today, I want to unpack some of those forces. We\u2019ll look at three key pillars of human behavior: emotional intelligence, social conditioning, and cognitive bias. These aren\u2019t just academic concepts\u2014they\u2019re the levers that determine how we think, act, and connect with others. Let\u2019s begin with something close to home for all of us: our emotions. [Theme 1: Emotional Intelligence",

And let me tell you, it\u2019s not just a nice-to-have skill; it\u2019s fundamental. Think of emotional intelligence as the operating system running quietly in the background. If it\u2019s functioning well, everything else\u2014communication, decision-making, conflict resolution\u2014works more smoothly. Now, EQ comprises a few components: self-awareness, self-regulation, empathy, and social skills.",

If you\u2019ve ever snapped at someone during a stressful day and then later realized you were really just anxious about a deadline, that\u2019s a moment of self-awareness\u2014coming after the fact. The goal is to move that recognition upstream. High emotional intelligence doesn\u2019t mean never feeling angry or anxious\u2014it means being able to identify those emotions in real time and manage your response. And that\u2019s powerful, because our emotions shape our behavior far more",

That\u2019s why we say or do things in the heat of the moment that we later regret. EQ is also contagious. In leadership settings, one emotionally attuned individual can shift the dynamic of an entire team. Empathy, in particular, isn\u2019t just about being nice\u2014it\u2019s about accurately reading others. Whether you're navigating a negotiation or comforting a friend, high",

This one is sneakier. It\u2019s like the architecture of the house you live in: mostly invisible, but it shapes how you move through the world. From a young age, we\u2019re bombarded with messages\u2014about success, gender roles, authority, love, even morality. Some of this conditioning is helpful.

Cognitive biases are mental shortcuts\u2014heuristics\u2014that help us make decisions quickly. That\u2019s great when you\u2019re driving or choosing what to eat for lunch.
