It\u2019s a pleasure to be here today, diving into a topic that touches every one of us, every single day\u2014decision making. Whether it\u2019s something as simple as choosing what to eat for breakfast or as complex as deciding on a career change, decision making is at the heart of our lives. Yet, despite its familiarity, it\u2019s often misunderstood. Why do we sometimes make choices",

Today, I want to unpack some of the psychology behind decision making, focusing on three key themes that shape our choices: emotional intelligence, social conditioning, and cognitive bias. By understanding these, we can gain clearer insight into how we decide\u2014and how to improve that process. 1. Emotional Intelligence: The Invisible Guide Let\u2019s start with emotional intelligence, or EQ, a term popularized by psychologist Daniel",

You might ask, what does emotion have to do with decision making, which we tend to associate with cold logic? It turns out, quite a lot. Imagine you\u2019re offered a new job in a different city. Logically, you list the pros and cons: salary, career growth, cost of living. But your gut feeling\u2014the anxiety about moving away from family, excitement about",

Neuroscientific research shows that the brain\u2019s emotional centers, like the amygdala, are deeply intertwined with the prefrontal cortex, which handles reasoning. When these parts work in harmony, decisions become richer and more nuanced. However, low emotional intelligence can lead to impulsive or overly cautious decisions. For instance, if fear dominates, you might avoid beneficial risks. Conversely, if emotions run unchecked, you might leap into choices without proper reflection. The key takeaway:",

Practicing mindfulness, journaling about our emotional states, or simply checking in with ourselves during tough choices can enhance this skill. 2. Social Conditioning: The Silent Script Moving on, let\u2019s consider social conditioning\u2014the values, norms, and expectations we absorb from our environment. From childhood, we\u2019re taught what\u2019s \u201cright\u201d or \u201cwrong,\u201d what\u2019s \u201cnormal,\u201d and what\u2019s \u201cdesirable.\u201d",

Cognitive Bias: The Mind\u2019s Hidden Shortcuts Finally, let\u2019s delve into cognitive bias\u2014the mental shortcuts our brain takes that can distort judgment. These biases are a natural byproduct of our brain\u2019s effort to process immense amounts of information efficiently, but they often lead us astray. One common bias is confirmation bias\u2014the tendency to seek out or remember information that supports our existing beliefs while ignoring contradictory",
