It\u2019s a real pleasure to be here with you today to talk about something that lies at the very heart of our understanding of human nature \u2014 how our early childhood experiences shape who we become as adults. Whether you\u2019re a psychologist, a coach, or simply someone curious about human behaviour, there\u2019s something universally compelling about tracing the roots of our personality",

How does the interplay between early emotional experiences, social conditioning, and cognitive patterns shape our responses, choices, and even our worldview? Today, I want to explore three key themes that illuminate this fascinating process: emotional intelligence, social conditioning, and cognitive biases \u2014 all deeply influenced by childhood. Along the way, I\u2019ll share some scientific insights and",

Emotional Intelligence: The Early Seeds of Self and Social Awareness Let\u2019s start with emotional intelligence \u2014 a concept popularized by Daniel Goleman but grounded in decades of developmental psychology.

Social Conditioning: The Invisible Scripts of Personality Next, let\u2019s talk about social conditioning \u2014 the process by which children absorb societal norms, roles, and expectations.
