    "text": "The Roots of Who We Are \u2014 How Childhood Shapes Human Behaviour and Personality Introduction Good morning, everyone. It\u2019s a real pleasure to be here today, diving into a topic that touches each one of us in profound ways: how our childhood experiences shape who we become as adults. When we think about human behaviour and personality, it might feel natural to assume these traits are fixed\u2014like some kind of genetic blueprint. But the truth is far more fascinating and",

Our early years are a critical window during which the complex architecture of our personality is formed, influenced by a dynamic interplay of emotional, social, and cognitive factors. Today, I want to explore three key themes that illustrate how childhood leaves its imprint on our behaviour: emotional intelligence, social conditioning, and cognitive biases. By understanding these, we can better appreciate not just why we behave the way we do, but also how we might grow beyond our early programming.",

This concept, popularized by psychologist Daniel Goleman, is not just a \u201csoft skill.\u201d It\u2019s a critical driver of our decision-making, relationships, and overall mental health. From birth, the emotional environment a child grows up in plays a pivotal role. For instance, consider the concept of \u201cattachment",

Think of it like the roots of a tree: secure and deep roots allow the tree to weather storms. Similarly, children with secure attachments tend to have better emotional regulation and social skills as adults.

Real-world example: Have you ever noticed how some people remain calm in a crisis while others spiral into panic? Often, this ability\u2014or inability\u2014to regulate emotions traces back to childhood experiences where either emotional needs were met or left unattended.

Theme 2: Social Conditioning \u2014 The Invisible Scripts That Guide Us Moving from the inner world to the social realm, the second major influence on behaviour and personality is social conditioning.
