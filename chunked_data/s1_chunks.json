    "text": "Why We Do What We Do: A Journey into Human Behaviour Good evening, everyone. Let me start with a question\u2014and be honest: Have you ever opened the fridge, stared inside for a full minute, then closed it\u2026 without taking anything? Yeah. Me too. Now, I don\u2019t know if we\u2019re hoping a block of chocolate will magically appear behind the broccoli, or if we\u2019re just hoping for a reason to exist, but that moment\u2014that quiet, weird little moment\u2014is a perfect example",
