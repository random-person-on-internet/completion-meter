Our topic is both personal and profound: the influence of childhood on personality. Now, I know that can sound a bit textbook, a little Freudian perhaps. But what I want to do today is peel away the abstract and dive into the tangible ways our early years sculpt who",

They are constructed \u2014 brick by brick \u2014 in a blueprint drafted long before we understood the word \"personality.\" So let\u2019s walk through three key dimensions of this influence: emotional intelligence, social conditioning, and cognitive bias.

Emotional Intelligence: The Bedrock of Human Navigation Let\u2019s begin with emotional intelligence, or EI. Daniel Goleman popularized this term in the 1990s, but its roots \u2014 pardon the pun \u2014 begin in childhood. Emotional intelligence refers to our ability to identify, understand, and regulate emotions \u2014 both our own and others\u2019.
