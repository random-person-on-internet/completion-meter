    "text": "Understanding Human Behavior: The Hidden Forces That Shape Us Good morning, everyone. It's a real pleasure to be here today among so many people who are curious\u2014not just about what we do as humans, but why we do it. Human behavior is one of the most fascinating puzzles we can study because, at the end of the day, we\u2019re all part of the experiment. We laugh, we cry, we overthink text messages, and we sometimes eat ice cream at 2",

Today, I want to unpack three key forces that shape our behavior: emotional intelligence, social conditioning, and cognitive bias. Together, these form a kind of invisible architecture that guides much of how we think, act, and interact\u2014often without us realizing it.

Think of it as the GPS for navigating social situations. Most of us like to believe we\u2019re rational creatures. But if we\u2019re honest, our emotions are often in the driver\u2019s seat.

And the research is clear: people with high EQs tend to have stronger relationships, better mental health, and even higher job performance. One powerful example is in conflict resolution. A manager with high EQ doesn\u2019t just fire off an email when things go wrong. They pause, consider how their words will be received, and address the issue constructively.

Our brains are magnificent, but they\u2019re not perfect. In order to process the overwhelming amount of information we encounter every day, the brain relies on shortcuts\u2014called heuristics. Most of the time, these help us make quick decisions. But sometimes, they lead us astray. A classic example is the confirmation bias\u2014our tendency to seek out information that",
