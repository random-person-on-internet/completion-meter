What\u2019s your take on that? Do you think being emotionally smart actually changes how we interact? Oh, absolutely. Emotional intelligence is huge. I mean, you can be the smartest person in the room, but if you can\u2019t read emotions or manage your own feelings, it\u2019s like you\u2019re operating on a different wavelength.",
