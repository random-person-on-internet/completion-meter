It\u2019s crazy how much is going on behind the scenes\u2014our emotions, our upbringing, even stuff we don\u2019t realize, like cognitive biases. Sometimes I wonder how much of what I do is really me, versus just conditioned responses. Exactly! Like, emotional intelligence plays a huge role. Some people seem naturally good at reading",

Therapy, mindfulness, even just paying more attention to how you react to stuff can help. Totally agree. And it\u2019s funny how that ties into social conditioning too.
