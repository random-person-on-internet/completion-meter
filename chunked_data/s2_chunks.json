It's often beautifully, maddeningly, hilariously predictable. Even when we think we\u2019re acting out of impulse or emotion, there\u2019s usually a deeper pattern underneath. A need. A fear. A belief. A story we\u2019re telling ourselves. Today, I want to explore that with you. Why do we do what we do? What drives human behavior? And how can understanding it help us become more compassionate, wiser\u2014and",
