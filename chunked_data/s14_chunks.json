    "text": "Wired for Change: The Psychology of Habit Formation Good afternoon, everyone. It's a privilege to be here today, speaking with so many curious and motivated minds, whether you're a clinician, coach, or someone on your own personal growth journey. Let\u2019s begin with a simple question: Why is it so hard to change a habit \u2014 and yet so effortless to form one we didn\u2019t intend to? You vow to eat healthier, and three weeks in, you're spoon-deep in a pint",

The truth is, habit formation isn\u2019t about willpower or discipline in the traditional sense. It's about understanding the psychological machinery behind behavior \u2014 how it's shaped, reinforced, and encoded. Today, we\u2019ll unpack three key dimensions of this process: emotional intelligence, social conditioning, and cognitive bias. These are the unseen",
