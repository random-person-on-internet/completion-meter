    "text": "Understanding Human Behaviour and Decision Making: The Hidden Forces Shaping Our Choices Good morning everyone, It\u2019s a privilege to be here today to talk about something we all experience every single day, yet seldom fully understand: human behaviour and decision making. We make thousands of decisions in our lives \u2014 from the mundane, like what to eat for breakfast, to the profound, like choosing a career path or forming relationships. But have you ever stopped to wonder, what really drives",

Today, I want to take you on a journey through some of the fascinating forces behind our behaviour and decision making. We\u2019ll explore three key themes: emotional intelligence, social conditioning, and cognitive biases. By understanding these, we can gain greater insight into ourselves and others\u2014and ultimately make better choices. 1.

At its core, emotional intelligence is our ability to recognize, understand, and manage our own emotions \u2014 and to empathize with others\u2019. Imagine you\u2019re in a stressful situation: maybe a disagreement with a colleague or a tough deadline. Your emotional intelligence influences how you respond. Someone with high EI might recognize their rising frustration and choose to pause, breathe, and respond thoughtfully instead of reacting impulsively. Why is this important",

Neuroscientific studies show that our brain\u2019s emotional centers, like the amygdala, often activate before our logical reasoning kicks in. This means emotions often steer us before our rational mind has a chance to weigh in. Consider the famous case of Phineas Gage, a 19th-century railroad worker who survived a severe brain injury to his frontal lobes. After the injury, although his intellect remained intact, his personality and",

In practical terms, developing emotional intelligence helps us create an \u201cinner compass\u201d that guides us toward decisions aligned with our values, reduces impulsivity, and improves interpersonal relationships. It\u2019s a skill we can cultivate through mindfulness, self-reflection, and empathetic listening. 2.

One well-known bias is the confirmation bias: the tendency to seek out and favor information that confirms our pre-existing beliefs while ignoring contradictory evidence. This bias explains why debates can become entrenched and why misinformation spreads so easily. Another example is the availability heuristic, where we judge the likelihood of events based on how easily examples come to mind. For",

Conclusion: Toward More Conscious Decision Making To wrap up, human behaviour and decision making are the product of complex, intertwined forces: the emotions that color our perceptions, the social frameworks that shape our beliefs, and the cognitive shortcuts our brains use to make sense of the world. Understanding emotional intelligence helps us manage our inner experiences with greater clarity and empathy.
