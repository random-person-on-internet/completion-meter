It\u2019s a pleasure to be here today to talk about something that touches every moment of our lives\u2014decision making. From the mundane to the monumental, every choice we make shapes our path, influences our relationships, and ultimately defines who we are. Yet, despite its importance, decision making is often more complex and subtle than we realize. Today, I want to explore the psychology behind how we",

Understanding these can help us make decisions that are not only smarter but also truer to ourselves. Introduction: Why Decision Making Matters Think about the last decision you made. Was it what to eat for lunch? Whether to accept a job offer? Or maybe how to respond in a difficult conversation? Each decision, regardless of size, involves weighing options, predicting outcomes, and managing internal and external pressures.",

Emotional intelligence (EI)\u2014the ability to recognize, understand, and manage our own emotions and those of others\u2014plays a critical role here. Neuroscience research shows that the areas of the brain involved in emotion, like the amygdala and ventromedial prefrontal cortex, are deeply connected to decision making. Patients with damage to these areas often struggle to make even simple choices because they lose the emotional signals that typically guide us.",
