Aisha: (sipping her coffee) You know what I’ve been thinking about lately? How much of our behaviour is actually ours, like truly self-determined, and how much is just... conditioning. It’s kind of unsettling.

Ben: (raising an eyebrow) What brought that on? A documentary or another late-night existential scroll through Reddit?

Aisha: Haha, guilty. It was actually a podcast—some behavioural psychologist was talking about how even our “free choices” are shaped by years of subtle cues, social norms, stuff like that.

Ben: Yeah, that’s pretty wild. I mean, when you think about it, we're basically walking bundles of responses—trained by our environments, reinforced by habits.

Aisha: Exactly. Like, think about how people react differently to the same situation depending on how they were raised. Someone who grew up in a chaotic household might see conflict and shut down, while someone else might get confrontational.

Ben: Right, like fight, flight, or freeze. That stuff gets wired in early. But I do think there's room for growth—emotional intelligence plays a big role in that.

Aisha: Oh, totally. Being aware of your triggers is half the battle. I used to get super defensive anytime someone gave me feedback at work. Like, even really tame stuff. I had to teach myself to pause and actually listen instead of reacting.

Ben: That’s emotional maturity right there. I’ve been trying to do that too, especially in relationships. You start noticing the patterns. Like, “Why did I just snap at my partner for leaving a dish out? Is it really about the dish?” Spoiler alert—it never is.

Aisha: (laughs) Never. It’s always something deeper. I read that a big part of emotional intelligence is naming your feelings accurately. Like instead of just saying "I'm angry," asking yourself if it’s actually disappointment or embarrassment or something else.

Ben: Yeah, labeling emotions properly helps regulate them. Otherwise, everything just becomes “I’m mad” or “I’m fine”—that classic emotional bottleneck.

Aisha: But it’s hard, right? Because we're not exactly taught to do that. Especially guys—no offense.

Ben: None taken. It’s true. I mean, growing up, if a boy cried, it was “man up.” If a girl cried, it was “she’s sensitive.” It’s all social conditioning. You’re taught which emotions are “acceptable” based on your gender, your culture, even your family’s vibe.

Aisha: It’s so ingrained. I used to think I was just naturally a people-pleaser, but I realized that was kind of a survival strategy. Like, “Don’t rock the boat, be likable.” But that takes a toll.

Ben: It does. You end up molding yourself to fit other people’s expectations. And then one day you wake up and go, “Wait, who even am I?”

Aisha: Yep. Cue identity crisis number seventeen.

Ben: (grinning) Been there. But that’s also where awareness kicks in. Once you start recognizing those patterns, you get a bit more control over them.

Aisha: Still, even with awareness, we’ve got all these cognitive biases messing with us. Like confirmation bias—only seeing what supports what you already believe.

Ben: Oh yeah, and the spotlight effect—thinking everyone’s noticing your flaws when they’re probably not even paying attention.

Aisha: Or fundamental attribution error—like when someone cuts you off in traffic and you’re like, “What a jerk,” but if you cut someone off, you’re like, “Oops, I was in a rush.”

Ben: Guilty. We’re so quick to judge others’ character but give ourselves a pass because of context. It’s just easier.

Aisha: Which is why I think self-compassion is underrated. Not in a fluffy way, but in the sense of understanding your own behaviour without excusing it. Like, “Okay, I snapped because I’m stressed, not because I’m a bad person. But I still need to own it.”

Ben: That balance is tricky. I’ve noticed that people either go full shame spiral or they completely deflect blame.

Aisha: True. Shame doesn’t really help, though. It just freezes you in place. Guilt, on the other hand, can motivate change—if you use it right.

Ben: Yeah, I think Brené Brown talks about that. Shame is “I am bad,” while guilt is “I did something bad.” Subtle difference, but huge impact on behaviour.

Aisha: Love her stuff. And it connects back to environment, too. If you’re in a workplace or relationship where mistakes are punished harshly, people are way less likely to take accountability. It becomes about survival.

Ben: Totally. Safe environments breed honesty and growth. If you’re always walking on eggshells, you’re not going to admit when you screw up.

Aisha: Which makes me wonder—how much of emotional intelligence is internal, and how much is allowed to grow because of your surroundings?

Ben: That’s a good question. I think it starts internally, but it thrives externally. Like, you might have the potential for empathy, but if you grow up in a place where vulnerability is mocked, it’s gonna stay buried.

Aisha: Yeah, that makes sense. You need space to practice it. Just like muscles—if you never use 'em, they atrophy.

Ben: And then there’s the whole nature versus nurture debate. Like, are some people just born more empathetic?

Aisha: I think some traits are innate—like temperament—but the way they show up is shaped by experience. A naturally empathetic kid raised in a cold environment might learn to shut it down as a defense.

Ben: Kind of like how you can have a naturally curious kid, but if they’re punished every time they ask questions, they stop asking.

Aisha: Exactly. We adapt. It’s survival.

Ben: But here’s a thought—if we’re that adaptable, doesn’t that mean we have more responsibility? Like, we can change, so we should?

Aisha: Hmm. Yes and no. I agree we have the capacity, but not everyone has the resources or support to make those changes. Trauma, mental health, socioeconomic stuff—it all plays a role.

Ben: Fair point. Sometimes people are just doing the best they can with what they’ve got. Doesn’t mean they shouldn’t be held accountable, but there’s gotta be some empathy in how we see each other.

Aisha: Empathy and boundaries, right? Like, understanding where someone’s coming from but still protecting your own peace.

Ben: Yep. Compassion without self-sacrifice. Hard balance.

Aisha: So basically, we’re all just trying to unlearn some stuff, learn better stuff, and hope we don’t mess up too badly in the process.

Ben: (laughs) Pretty much. Life is one big behaviour experiment—with no control group.

Aisha: I like that. Makes me feel a little less guilty about all the trial and error.

Ben: Same. As long as we’re learning from the data.

Aisha: Spoken like a true psych nerd.

Ben: Guilty as charged. Want another coffee? This conversation feels like it could keep going.

Aisha: Definitely. Let’s keep dissecting the human condition over caffeine and questionable pastries.
