You ever wonder how much of who we are is just baked into us from childhood?


All the time. I actually think about it too much. Like, I’ll catch myself reacting to something — say, someone criticizing me — and my first instinct is defensiveness. Then I think, Where did that come from? And inevitably, it’s some childhood dynamic.


Yeah, totally. I feel like our default behaviours — especially under stress — are basically like echoes from when we were five. Emotional muscle memory.


That’s a good way of putting it. And I think emotional intelligence plays a huge role too. If you were raised in a household where emotions weren’t talked about or validated, you're basically set up to struggle with emotional awareness as an adult.


For sure. Like, if your parents never modeled naming emotions or showing vulnerability, how would you even know how to do it? You’d just shove it down and carry on. Or worse, act it out in weird ways.


Exactly. And then we call that “personality.” Oh, she’s just cold. He’s got a temper. No, that’s probably a kid who wasn’t given the tools to express what they feel in a healthy way.


But then, don’t you think there's a point where the responsibility shifts? Like, once we’re aware of all that — our conditioning, our baggage — doesn’t it become our job to rewire it?


Absolutely. But that awareness doesn’t just appear. Some people go their whole lives without ever realizing how much of their behaviour is conditioning. They think they’re choosing, but half the time they’re just reacting.


Yeah, reacting versus responding — that’s such a core difference. Reacting is automatic. Responding involves reflection. And the tricky part is that our biases, even the subconscious ones, get in the way.


Totally. Cognitive biases are like the invisible strings. Confirmation bias, especially — once you believe something about yourself or the world, your brain just filters for evidence to support that.


Oh man, yeah. Like if you grew up being told you weren’t smart, every mistake you make just reinforces that belief. Meanwhile, someone else might make the same mistake and just brush it off.


That’s where environment really plays a huge role too. Not just family, but school, peers, even the media you consume growing up. It all wires you. I think a lot of people underestimate how much culture shapes personality.


And how it shapes emotional range. Like in some families, expressing anger is taboo. In others, it’s the only emotion anyone ever shows. You end up emotionally lopsided.


Right. And then later in life, you might struggle in relationships because you’ve got this narrow emotional vocabulary. Like trying to paint a landscape with only two colours.


Good metaphor. That’s where therapy comes in for a lot of people. It’s like emotional literacy classes for adults.


Yeah, it should be mandatory, honestly. Even just learning how to sit with discomfort — that’s a skill most of us weren’t taught. We were taught to fix or avoid, not to feel.


And that avoidance creates patterns. Like people-pleasing, perfectionism, addiction — all coping mechanisms we pick up when we’re young and scared and don’t have better tools.


I used to think I was just a natural overachiever. Turns out I was just terrified of disappointing people. Huge difference.


Haha, same. I thought I was chill. Turns out I was just emotionally shut down for a while. Takes a while to tease that apart.


It really does. And even when you intellectually get it, the behaviour doesn’t change overnight. That’s the frustrating part.


That’s where neuroplasticity comes in, though. Like, we know now that the brain can change — but it takes repetition and conscious effort. You have to interrupt the loop.


Yep. And honestly, community helps. Surrounding yourself with people who model healthier behaviour, who call you out gently, who create space for honesty — that’s transformative.


I’ve noticed that too. Like, once I started hanging out with emotionally aware people, I started becoming more aware myself. It’s contagious, in a good way.


Exactly. That’s why environment isn’t just about childhood — it matters now too. You can’t always fix what happened, but you can shift your surroundings to support who you want to become.


Oof, that’s a quotable. "Shift your surroundings to support who you want to become." That’s some therapist-level wisdom right there.


Haha, I’ll take that. But seriously — it’s all connected. Childhood, environment, conditioning, even our definitions of success or love — it’s all filtered through the lens of how we were raised.


Okay, devil’s advocate for a second — what about personality traits that seem more innate? Like introversion or impulsivity. Is it all childhood?


Fair question. I think temperament is a real thing. Some kids are more sensitive or curious or reactive, right from the start. But even those traits get shaped by environment. Like, a curious kid might thrive or shut down depending on how adults respond to their questions.


So nature gives the raw material, and nurture sculpts it?


Exactly. You might be born with a loud voice, but your environment decides whether you become a singer, a talk show host, or someone who learns to stay quiet.


I love that. It makes it feel more dynamic — like we’re not stuck with the hand we were dealt, but we can also respect where we came from.


Totally. It’s both compassion and accountability. Understand where your behaviour comes from, but don’t use it as a permanent excuse.


So basically, the goal is to parent yourself better than you were parented?


That’s one way to put it. Or just... give yourself what you needed but didn’t get. Validation, boundaries, safety, curiosity. All of it.


Wild how simple that sounds, and yet it’s some of the hardest work there is.


Tell me about it. But it’s also kind of beautiful, right? Like we get a second shot at shaping who we are — not perfectly, but intentionally.


Yeah. We can’t rewrite the first chapter, but we’re the ones holding the pen now.
