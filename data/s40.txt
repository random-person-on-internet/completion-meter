 (sipping coffee) So, I’ve been down a rabbit hole lately watching videos about human behaviour — everything from cognitive biases to social conditioning. It’s wild how much of what we do isn’t really “us,” you know?

 Oh yeah, totally. I mean, most people like to think they’re in control of their actions, but half the time it’s just scripts running in the background. We’re like meat computers with emotional algorithms.

 (laughs) That’s one way to put it. But seriously, take emotional intelligence — it’s not just about “being nice” or reading facial expressions. It’s more about self-awareness, empathy, managing your own impulses…

 Right, and yet it’s rarely taught. You go through school learning algebra and the mitochondria, but not how to handle it when your boss snaps at you or your friend’s passive-aggressive text throws you into a spiral.

 Exactly! And people who lack emotional intelligence, they can be incredibly smart — IQ-wise — but socially, they trip over themselves.

 Yeah, or worse, they bulldoze everyone around them. High IQ, low EQ types often can’t see how abrasive they are. But to play devil’s advocate, sometimes emotional intelligence is used as this vague, moral high ground — like, “I’m more evolved because I can name my feelings.”

 Hmm, I see what you mean, but isn’t that kind of the point? Naming the feeling helps regulate it. Like, instead of lashing out, you realize you’re just anxious or embarrassed, and that buys you time to respond instead of react.

 Sure, but people weaponize that too. Ever had someone say, “I’m just being emotionally honest,” right before they dump all their negative crap on you?

 (chuckles) Oh yeah. Emotional honesty without boundaries is just emotional dumping. There’s a fine line.

 Speaking of lines — what do you think about social conditioning? I’ve been re-reading some old sociology stuff, and it’s kind of disturbing how predictable we can be.

 Like the Milgram experiment? Or more subtle things?

 Both. But more subtle stuff lately. Like how the design of a room can influence whether people collaborate or compete. Or how gender roles are baked into us before we even know what they are.

 Oh, for sure. I read this study where kids were shown two identical babies dressed differently — one in blue, one in pink — and adults described the “blue baby” as strong and adventurous and the “pink baby” as delicate and sweet.

 Yeah, and that’s without any actual difference in behaviour. Just pure projection.

 It makes you wonder — how much of what we think is “me” is really just what we’ve absorbed without question?

 That’s the scary part. Even our biases feel like truths. Confirmation bias, for instance — you could be completely wrong about something, but as long as you keep finding stuff that agrees with you, your brain just goes, “Yep, nailed it.”

 Don’t even get me started on that one. I was arguing with someone online about climate change and realized halfway through — I wasn’t trying to learn anything. I just wanted to be right.

 Honest of you to admit that. Most people double down. That’s the backfire effect, right? Present someone with evidence that contradicts their belief, and instead of changing their mind, they dig in deeper.

 It’s wild. Like our brains treat being wrong as a threat to survival.

 Well, evolutionarily, maybe it kind of was. If you misjudged a threat, you were dead. So being right — or at least feeling right — became a survival tool.

 Makes sense. But now it’s maladaptive. Like, in a tribal society, trusting your gut might’ve kept you alive. But today, your gut might just be your unconscious bias playing dress-up.

 That’s poetic. But yeah, like, people see a certain type of person and instantly make judgments. Not because they’re evil — it’s just pattern recognition gone rogue.

 That’s why I think environment is so powerful. It can either reinforce those biases or help you break out of them. You spend time in diverse spaces, or with people who challenge you, and suddenly you realize — not everyone thinks like you, and that’s okay.

 True. Though I’d argue that even then, the brain is always looking for shortcuts. Like, even if you expand your world, your brain still wants to categorize. It’s exhausting to question everything all the time.

 So what’s the balance then? Accept the mental shortcuts but keep checking them?

 Maybe. Like, don’t beat yourself up for having a bias, but don’t let it be your final answer either.

 That reminds me of something I heard — “You can’t control your first thought, but you can control your second.” Like, your gut reaction might be conditioned, but your next move is up to you.

 That’s a solid mantra. I like that. And honestly, that’s where growth happens. In that pause between stimulus and response.

 That space is where all our power is, right? Between getting cut off in traffic and deciding not to flip someone off. (laughs)

 (laughs too) Or deciding to flip them off, but with mindfulness.

 Mindful road rage. I love it.

 But seriously, I think a lot of human behaviour is reactive. And the more aware you are of what’s driving your reaction — your upbringing, your mood, the lighting in the room even — the more choice you actually have.

 Totally. Like, awareness doesn’t always mean change, but it opens the door. You can’t change what you don’t even see.

 Exactly. And sometimes you still mess up, but at least you’re conscious about it. There’s dignity in that.

 That’s beautifully said. It’s like we’re all just trying to unlearn half of what we were taught, while learning how to be decent humans at the same time.

 Which is hard. Especially when everyone else seems to be winging it too.

 No manual, just vibes and trauma.

 (laughs) That should be a T-shirt.

 I’d buy that. Anyway, thanks for indulging my psychology ramble. Always nice to bounce these thoughts around.

 Are you kidding? I live for this stuff. Next time, let’s talk about free will and how it might be an illusion.

 Ooh, now that’s a rabbit hole I’m ready for.

 You bring the coffee, I’ll bring the existential dread.
