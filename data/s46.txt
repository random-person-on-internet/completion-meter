So, I’ve been reading this book on habit loops—how cues, routines, and rewards basically shape our lives. It’s wild how much of our behavior is just automated.


Oh, totally! I think it’s something like 40% of our actions every day are habits. We like to think we’re in control, but honestly, half the time we’re just running on autopilot.


Right? And then we beat ourselves up for not having more willpower, but it’s not even about willpower most of the time—it’s about environment and repetition.


Exactly! Environment plays such a sneaky role. Like, have you ever tried eating healthier but you live with someone who stockpiles chips and cookies?


(laughs) That’s literally my roommate. I swear I don’t even want junk food until I see it on the counter.


That’s classic behavioral cue stuff. The environment triggers the habit loop. And once the loop’s been reinforced enough times, it becomes second nature.


What’s interesting too is how much of our behavior is conditioned by stuff we never consciously agreed to. Like social norms. You grow up thinking certain things are "just how people are," and then you realize... oh wait, that’s just how my culture wired me.


Yeah! Social conditioning runs deep. It’s why people from different parts of the world react so differently to things like conflict or affection. You’re basically trained from birth to interpret certain behaviors as good or bad.


And then emotional intelligence kicks in—being able to notice how you’re reacting, and why, and whether it’s really you or just your programming.


Mm-hmm. I think emotional intelligence is underrated, honestly. People treat it like it’s this fluffy concept, but it’s so foundational. If you can’t recognize your own triggers, how can you even begin to change your habits?


Yeah. I had this realization during a tough meeting last year. I always thought I was just "bad at confrontation." But really, I’d been trained to avoid conflict because I saw my parents explode whenever they argued. So I associated confrontation with disaster.


Oof, that’s relatable. My go-to is people-pleasing. I’ll bend over backwards to keep the peace, even when it means I’m not honoring my own boundaries. Only recently started unlearning that.


It’s crazy how these patterns play out decades later. And don’t even get me started on cognitive biases. Our brains just love to lie to us.


(laughs) Oh yeah. Confirmation bias is my nemesis. I’ll read like three articles that agree with me and think, “See? I knew I was right.”


Same! And the anchoring effect? That one gets me. Like, if the first number I hear is $100, suddenly $70 seems like a steal—even if it's still overpriced.


That’s why sales work! Mark it at $200, slash it to $150, and suddenly we feel like we’re saving money. We’re so predictably irrational.


I love that phrase—“predictably irrational.” It really captures how we're not just random in our mistakes. We’re predictably wrong in very specific ways.


Yeah, and what’s ironic is that once you know about these biases, it doesn't necessarily make you immune to them.


True. It’s like knowing your brain has blind spots doesn’t mean you can see through them. You just know they’re there.


So how do we actually change behavior, then? Awareness is step one, sure, but what’s step two?


I think consistency matters more than intensity. Like, instead of trying to change everything overnight, you tweak one tiny habit—like flossing one tooth—and build from there.


(laughs) I’ve heard that one! It’s the BJ Fogg method, right? “Floss one tooth and celebrate.” I used to think it was silly, but it actually works.


Yup. And habit stacking helps too. Like, linking a new habit to an existing one. I started doing five push-ups right after brushing my teeth. It’s stupid easy, but it’s stuck for over a year now.


That’s clever. I’ve been trying something similar with meditation. I do it right after my morning coffee—before my brain gets too noisy.


Smart. I find mornings are the golden hour for habit-building. Once the day starts throwing curveballs, all bets are off.


But don’t you think emotions mess with that, though? Like, even if I’ve built a habit, if I’m anxious or upset, I might just ignore it.


Yeah, emotion regulation is a big part of the puzzle. That's where mindfulness and emotional intelligence intersect with habits. If you don’t have strategies for dealing with stress or boredom, you’ll default to old habits.


Totally. That’s why I think behavior change has to be holistic. You can’t just say “do X every day” without also addressing how people feel and think.


Agreed. That’s probably why most New Year’s resolutions fail. People aim for behavior change without any emotional scaffolding.


Emotional scaffolding—I like that. It’s like building a new routine on top of shaky emotional ground. It’s not gonna hold.


Yeah. And speaking of shaky ground, sometimes I wonder how much agency we really have. Like, are we actually making choices, or just playing out scripts?


That’s deep. I think we can rewrite the script—but only once we realize we’re in one. The tricky part is waking up to it.


And once you do, the work begins. Which, honestly, can be exhausting.


Yep. Growth is hard. But stagnation’s harder in the long run. At least with growth, there’s meaning in the struggle.


Spoken like someone who's done the inner work!


(laughs) Still doing it. Probably always will be. But hey, maybe that’s the habit worth forming—staying curious about yourself.


I love that. Curiosity as a habit. Could be the antidote to a lot of our unconscious behavior, honestly.


Exactly. Awareness without judgment. Just... "Oh, that’s interesting. I wonder why I did that." That mindset changes everything.


I’m gonna steal that. Next time I find myself doom-scrolling or snapping at someone, I’ll try to ask, “Hmm, what’s really going on here?”


Do it. It’s a game-changer. And hey, if you slip up, no big deal. The point isn’t perfection—it’s noticing.


Yeah. Progress, not perfection. Alright, I feel like I just had a therapy session. Thanks for the deep dive, Priya.


Anytime! Always happy to overanalyze human nature with you.
