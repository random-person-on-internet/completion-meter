You ever notice how hard it is to break a habit, even when you know it’s bad for you?


Oh, totally. I’ve been trying to stop scrolling through my phone before bed for, like, a year. Every night I tell myself, “Tonight I’ll read.” Ten minutes later I’m knee-deep in cat videos and conspiracy theories.


[laughs] Right? It’s like we know better, but our brains just… don’t care. It’s fascinating. I’ve been reading about how habits are these loops—cue, routine, reward. Once that loop is set, your brain just follows it automatically.


That’s from Charles Duhigg’s book, right? The Power of Habit?


Yeah! That one. He explains it so well. But what got me thinking was how much of our behavior isn’t about willpower—it’s about environment. Like, I moved my phone charger to the kitchen, and suddenly I wasn’t on Instagram until 1 a.m.


That’s such a good point. We underestimate how much our surroundings shape what we do. It’s not just about being “disciplined”—sometimes it’s just about not having temptation literally within arm’s reach.


Exactly. And I think that applies to bigger stuff too. Like, the people we hang out with, the kinds of conversations we have, even how a workplace is set up—it all nudges our behavior.


That reminds me of social conditioning. We like to think we’re independent thinkers, but so much of what we do is just… learned behavior. Stuff we absorbed from family, school, media—without even realizing it.


Oh yeah, for sure. Like how people react in conflict—some of that is emotional intelligence, but a lot of it is modeled behavior. If you grew up around people who shut down or yelled during arguments, you might default to that without thinking.


That’s where emotional intelligence really kicks in, right? The ability to notice your own reactions and go, “Okay, wait, why am I doing this?” instead of just lashing out or avoiding the issue.


Totally. It’s like pressing pause on autopilot. But that pause takes practice. It’s not natural for most people, especially under stress.


Yeah, it’s like rewiring your brain—literally. I read somewhere that the more you practice emotional regulation, the stronger those neural pathways get. Like a mental muscle.


Neuroplasticity! That’s the cool part—we can change, but it takes intention and consistency. And support helps. Like, if your friends are emotionally intelligent, it rubs off on you.


For sure. But what about cognitive biases? I feel like they mess with us in subtle ways we don’t even notice. Like confirmation bias—we only see what supports our existing beliefs.


Ugh, yes. And then there’s the fundamental attribution error—assuming someone else’s bad behavior is a character flaw, but when we mess up, it’s because of circumstances.


[laughs] Guilty. “He cut me off because he’s a jerk.” But if I do it, it’s because I’m late and stressed and there was no space to merge.


Exactly. And I think those biases make it harder to build empathy. Or even self-awareness. Because we’re seeing everything through this distorted lens.


Which brings us back to emotional intelligence. Like, recognizing when your ego is doing the talking. Or when your brain’s just taking mental shortcuts because it’s lazy.


[laughs] Our brains are lazy! Not in a bad way—they’re just trying to be efficient. But that efficiency can be dangerous. Especially when it comes to forming judgments or habits without reflection.


It’s kind of wild how much of human behavior is unconscious. We like to believe we’re rational creatures, but honestly? We're mostly running on autopilot, reacting to cues around us.


Totally. And I think once you realize that, you can start making small changes. Like, becoming more intentional about your environment, your routines, who you talk to, what media you consume.


Yeah, like shaping your environment to shape your behavior. James Clear talks about that a lot in Atomic Habits—how tiny changes in your surroundings can lead to big results over time.


Yes! Like putting your workout clothes by your bed, or keeping junk food out of the house. It’s not about resisting all the time—it’s about making the right thing the easy thing.


Okay, but can I play devil’s advocate for a second?


Of course.


Isn’t there a risk in over-structuring your life? Like, if we’re always optimizing habits and curating our environments, do we lose spontaneity? Or stop building resilience to deal with discomfort?


Hmm, that’s a fair point. I think there’s a balance. Structure helps when you're trying to change behavior, but life’s still messy and unpredictable. You need flexibility too—emotional agility, maybe?


Yeah, that’s a good phrase—emotional agility. Like being able to adapt without spiraling. Maybe the goal isn’t rigid control over our habits, but being aware of them. So we can choose more often, instead of just reacting.


Exactly. Like, being able to say, “Oh, I’m reaching for my phone again. What am I actually feeling right now?” Boredom? Anxiety? Avoidance?


And then asking yourself if the habit is serving you or just soothing you. Big difference.


Whoa, yeah. That hits. There’s a quote I love—“Don’t trade what you want most for what you want now.” I think about that a lot when I’m tempted to binge-watch shows instead of working on my writing.


Oh man, that’s me with chips and Netflix when I should be prepping for Monday meetings. [laughs]


We’ve all been there. But I think the key is not beating yourself up. Just noticing the pattern, adjusting, and trying again tomorrow.


Right. Self-compassion goes a long way. Honestly, sometimes that’s the missing piece. People think they need more discipline, but what they really need is less shame and more curiosity about their own behavior.


Yes! Be curious, not judgmental. Like, “Why do I keep doing this?” instead of “Ugh, I suck.” That shift alone can change everything.


Totally agree. It’s not about being perfect—it’s about understanding yourself better, so you can grow.


Exactly. And maybe even help others do the same. Imagine if we all paid a little more attention to our habits, our triggers, and how we affect each other…


The world would be a lot more emotionally intelligent, that’s for sure.


And probably a little kinder, too.
