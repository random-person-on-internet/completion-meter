“Why We Do What We Do: A Look Into Human Behavior”

Good [morning/afternoon/evening] everyone,

Let me start by asking you a simple question:

Have you ever watched someone do something completely irrational and thought—“What on earth were they thinking?”

Maybe it was your friend who swore they were on a diet… until they saw cake. Or maybe it was you, standing in front of the fridge at 1 a.m., eating shredded cheese straight from the bag. We’ve all been there.

We laugh at those moments—and sometimes cringe—but here’s the fascinating part:

Human behavior is rarely random. It's often beautifully, maddeningly, hilariously predictable. Even when we think we’re acting out of impulse or emotion, there’s usually a deeper pattern underneath. A need. A fear. A belief. A story we’re telling ourselves.

Today, I want to explore that with you. Why do we do what we do? What drives human behavior? And how can understanding it help us become more compassionate, wiser—and maybe even a little less weird?

Thesis:
Human behavior is shaped by three powerful forces—our biology, our environment, and our stories. And when we become aware of these forces, we not only understand others better—we understand ourselves.

Let’s dive in.

Point 1: Biology—We Are Wired to Survive, Not to Be Rational
Let’s start with the oldest force—our biology.

Now, you might think you’re a modern, highly evolved person. You use Google Calendar, you know how to make a latte, maybe even do yoga. But deep down… you’re still a caveman.

Or cavewoman. Or cave-person.

The human brain hasn’t changed that much in 100,000 years. We’re still running on ancient hardware, built not for happiness or logic—but for survival.

Let me give you an example.

Imagine you're walking through the woods, and suddenly a bush rustles.

Now, your brain has two options:

Option A: It’s just the wind.

Option B: It’s a bear.

Which one does your brain pick?

The bear. Every time. Because if you’re wrong about the wind, no big deal. But if you’re wrong about the bear… well, you just became lunch.

This is called negativity bias—our brains are hardwired to pay more attention to threats than to positive things. That’s why one rude comment can ruin your whole day, even if ten people said something nice.

It’s also why we procrastinate, why we panic in traffic, and why we sometimes yell at our loved ones over the dumbest things. Our brain is trying to protect us—but it's using ancient instincts for modern problems.

And let’s not even start on the amygdala—the little almond-shaped part of your brain that acts like your personal alarm system. It doesn’t know the difference between “I’m being chased by a lion” and “My boss just sent me a vague email.”

So the next time you find yourself spiraling over something small, pause. Take a breath. Remind yourself: It’s just my caveman brain doing its thing.

Point 2: Environment—We Are Mirrors of the World Around Us
Now, if biology is the hardwiring, environment is the software. It shapes our habits, beliefs, and behavior in subtle—and sometimes not-so-subtle—ways.

Let me tell you a quick story.

A few years ago, there was a study done in a hospital cafeteria. Researchers simply rearranged the drink fridge so that water was easier to reach than soda. Guess what happened?

Soda sales dropped by nearly 11%. And water sales went up by 25%.

No rules changed. No signs were posted. No lectures about sugar or diabetes. They just made the healthy choice easier.

That’s the power of environment.

We like to think we have strong willpower. But most of the time, our behavior is a response to what’s around us.

You see this in everyday life:

When you're in a messy room, your mind feels chaotic.

When everyone in your office stays late, you feel guilty leaving at 5.

When your friend group starts running marathons, suddenly you’re shopping for running shoes.

Humans are social creatures. We reflect the energy and expectations of our environment—often without even realizing it.

And it goes deeper.

Growing up, if you were constantly praised for being “the smart one,” you might still tie your worth to achievement. If you were told “boys don’t cry” or “don’t make a scene,” you may still hesitate to express emotion, even decades later.

The environments we live in—from our families to our cultures—teach us who to be. And that conditioning can run so deep, we mistake it for truth.

But here’s the good news: Just like software, it can be updated.

When we become conscious of how our environment shapes us, we can make new choices. We can create surroundings that support who we want to become, not just who we’ve been told to be.

Point 3: Stories—We Are the Narratives We Tell Ourselves
Now let’s talk about the most human force of all: the power of story.

Because at the end of the day, we are not just biological creatures. We are not just products of our environment. We are storytellers. And more importantly—we believe our own stories.

Let me ask you something.

Have you ever said—or thought—any of these?

“I’m just not a math person.”

“I could never do that.”

“I always mess things up.”

“This is just who I am.”

These aren’t facts. They’re stories. And often, they’re inherited from someone else’s voice. A teacher, a parent, a partner, society.

We internalize them so deeply that they become part of our identity. But identities are not fixed. They’re made. They’re made of the stories we repeat to ourselves.

Here’s a personal example.

I used to believe I was terrible at public speaking. I was the kid who turned red in class just reading aloud. My hands would shake. My voice would wobble. So I told myself: “I’m just not a speaker.”

That story stuck for years—until one day, I got so tired of being afraid that I signed up for a local storytelling night. My voice cracked. My timing was off. But when it was over… people clapped. Some even laughed. And I thought, maybe I’m not terrible. Maybe I just need practice.

That one night started a new story.

The story that says: “I’m someone who can grow. Who can change.”

And that story? That story changed everything.

Because here’s the truth:

Our behavior follows our beliefs. If you believe you’re not worthy of love, you’ll push people away. If you believe you’re bad at money, you won’t try to save. If you believe you’re stuck—you will be.

But if you believe you can change—then everything becomes possible.

So What Do We Do With This Knowledge?
We’ve covered a lot today.

We’ve talked about how our biology wires us for survival, not logic. How our environment shapes our choices, often invisibly. And how the stories we tell ourselves can either limit or liberate us.

So what do we do with all this?

First: Compassion.

Understanding human behavior should make us more forgiving—of others and ourselves. When someone cuts you off in traffic or snaps at you, remember: they’re not just being difficult. They’re being human. There’s probably a fear, a pattern, or a story underneath.

Second: Curiosity.

Instead of reacting to your own behavior with shame, get curious. Ask: Where did that come from? What am I afraid of? What story am I believing right now?

Third—and most importantly: Choice.

You may not be able to change your biology. You can’t always change your environment. But you can change your story.

You can choose to write a new chapter. One where you're not just surviving, but growing. One where your past doesn't define your future. One where being human means being beautifully imperfect—and endlessly capable of transformation.

Conclusion: The Mirror and the Window
I want to leave you with one final image.

Imagine that every moment of human behavior—every tantrum, every act of kindness, every awkward conversation—is both a mirror and a window.

A mirror—showing you something about yourself.
And a window—offering a glimpse into someone else’s world.

When we pause to really see people—not just what they do, but why they do it—we begin to connect. We begin to understand. And in that understanding, we find compassion, growth, and maybe even healing.

So the next time someone surprises you—or you surprise yourself—don’t rush to judge. Pause. Ask. Listen.

Because behind every action is a story. And behind every story… is a human, just trying their best.

Thank you.
