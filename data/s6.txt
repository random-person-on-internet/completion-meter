"The Puzzle of Human Behavior: Why We Do What We Do"

Good evening, everyone.

Let me ask you something simple—but also incredibly complicated.

Why do people do what they do? Why does a stranger stop to help you pick up your groceries when your bag rips on the sidewalk... while another just walks past, eyes glued to their phone?

Why does a child lie about breaking a vase—then cry about it ten minutes later? Why do we sabotage relationships we care about, chase dreams that hurt us, or cling to things we know we should let go?

Human behavior is one of the great mysteries of life. It's unpredictable, fascinating, and sometimes heartbreaking. And no matter how advanced we get—no matter how many books we write, or algorithms we code—there's something deeply untameable about the way we behave.

Tonight, I want to explore that. I want to dive into what drives us—what shapes our actions, our kindness, our cruelty, our courage, and our fears. Not from a textbook or a lecture hall, but from the messy, beautiful, confusing thing we all share: being human.

Thesis:

At its core, human behavior is driven by emotion, shaped by experience, and changed by connection. We are not logic machines—we are feeling creatures, living stories we don’t always understand until long after the chapter’s closed.

And sometimes, our behavior comes from pain.

Let me tell you a story.

Point 1: Behavior Is Often a Reflection of Emotion, Not Logic

A few years ago, I had a friend—let’s call him Sam.

Sam was brilliant. One of those people who could quote philosophers one minute and tell a dumb joke the next. But Sam had a temper. Small things would set him off—someone taking too long in line, a friend canceling plans, even a slow internet connection. He wasn’t cruel, but he was... on edge. Defensive. Hard to talk to sometimes.

One night, over drinks, I asked him, gently, “Why do you get so angry?”

And he looked at me, eyes tired, and said, “Because I’m scared.”

That moment floored me.

You see, what looked like anger on the surface—was really anxiety underneath. What looked like impatience was actually fear of being forgotten, abandoned. His behavior wasn’t about what was happening now—it was about things that happened years ago, things he’d never really healed from.

This is the first key point:
So much of our behavior is emotional. Not rational. Not logical. Emotional.

We lash out because we’re hurting. We stay silent because we’re afraid. We chase attention because we feel invisible.

It’s easy to judge someone based on what they do. It’s harder—but more important—to ask why.

So I try, now, when someone’s being difficult or cold or confusing—I try to remember: there’s probably something I can’t see. Some pain I don’t know about.

Isn’t that true for all of us?

Point 2: Our Behavior Is Shaped by Our Experiences—Especially the Painful Ones

Let me take you back to when I was 12 years old.

It was a Thursday afternoon. I remember because Thursdays were pizza day at school. I was walking home with a classmate—let’s call her Maya. Maya was quiet, kept to herself. But that day, she asked if I wanted to see something. We stopped by the corner store and she pulled out a handful of coins. She bought a chocolate bar... then pocketed another, without paying.

I froze.

She looked at me and said, “Don’t tell. It’s for my little brother. He hasn’t eaten today.”

That moment broke something in me—and built something else.

Before that day, I thought stealing was just wrong, full stop. You steal, you’re a bad person. But suddenly it wasn’t that simple. Maya wasn’t bad—she was desperate. She was 12, caring for her brother, and doing what she thought she had to do.

This is the second point:
Our behavior is not just about who we are—it’s about what we’ve lived through.

If you’ve grown up with love, safety, and stability—it’s easier to be kind, to be generous, to be open. But if your life has been marked by trauma, by hunger, by betrayal—your behavior changes. You become guarded. Or aggressive. Or numb.

And yet, we judge so quickly, don’t we?

We see someone struggling and think they’re lazy. Someone crying and think they’re weak. Someone cold and think they’re cruel.

But maybe they’re just tired. Maybe they’re just protecting themselves the only way they know how.

We are all, in some way, shaped by our pain.

Point 3: Human Behavior Can Be Transformed Through Connection

Now here’s where it gets hopeful.

Because while pain shapes us, connection changes us.

Have you ever had someone believe in you when you didn’t believe in yourself?

There was a teacher I had in high school. Mr. Dawson. He taught history, wore terrible ties, and believed I could write—even when I turned in papers late, even when I mumbled through presentations.

He pulled me aside once and said, “I don’t care if you’re scared. Your voice matters. Use it.”

No one had ever said that to me before.

And slowly, I started to believe it. I started to speak up. To write more. And eventually, to stand on stages like this one.

Why?

Because someone saw something in me I couldn’t see yet.

This is the third and most powerful point:
Our behavior can change. We can grow. Heal. Become better versions of ourselves. But we can’t do it alone.

We need people who see us, who challenge us, who love us even when we’re hard to love.

And we need to be those people for each other.

A Moment of Reflection:

But let me be honest.

Not every story has a happy ending.

Remember my friend Sam?

He was getting better. He was in therapy, opening up. But then one night, he called me. I missed the call. I was busy, tired, figured I’d talk to him the next day.

There wasn’t a next day.

He died by suicide the following morning.

And I’ve carried that guilt, that grief, ever since.

That’s the thing about human behavior—it’s fragile. Fleeting. Sometimes, we don't see the signs until it’s too late.

So if you take nothing else from this tonight, let it be this:

Be kind. Even when people are difficult.
Be present. Even when you’re tired.
Ask questions. Even when it’s awkward.

Because people are fighting battles you cannot see. And sometimes, a single moment of compassion can make all the difference.

Conclusion:

Human behavior is a puzzle—made of emotion, shaped by experience, changed by love.

We laugh. We cry. We hurt each other. We heal each other.
We are walking contradictions—brave and scared, selfish and generous, broken and whole, all at once.

But here’s the beautiful part:

We can choose how we show up in the world.

We can choose to listen.
We can choose to forgive.
We can choose to try again, even when we’ve failed before.

So the next time someone behaves in a way you don’t understand, pause before judging.

And when you behave in a way you don’t understand—pause, and ask yourself: What am I feeling? What have I lived through? Who do I need to reach for?

Because in the end, we’re not just products of biology or society.

We’re stories. Complex, imperfect, and human.

And every story matters.

Thank you.
