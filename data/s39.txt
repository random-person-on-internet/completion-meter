So, I read this thing the other day about how people make like 95% of their decisions on autopilot. Like, subconscious patterns, habits, that kind of thing. It’s wild when you think about how little we’re actually choosing.


Oh yeah, I’ve heard that too. I think it ties into cognitive biases, right? Like we think we’re rational, but really we’re just kind of responding to patterns we’ve learned over time.


Exactly. And then we justify it later with logic. I think that’s called "post hoc rationalization"?


Yep. Classic human behaviour. We’re basically storytelling machines trying to make sense of our own choices. But it makes you wonder—how much of what we do is really us versus, like, programming?


That’s the big question. I mean, think about social conditioning. From the moment we’re born, we’re getting these signals—what’s good, what’s bad, what success looks like, what failure is. It’s everywhere: family, media, school...


Yeah, I remember growing up thinking that being “nice” meant not speaking up, not rocking the boat. Took me years to unlearn that. Emotional intelligence helped a lot there—just recognizing your own patterns, how you're reacting emotionally, you know?


Absolutely. And also being able to read other people, too. Like, I used to think emotional intelligence was just about managing your own feelings. But it’s just as much about empathy and navigating social situations.


For sure. I had this manager once—terrible technical skills, but phenomenal emotional intelligence. He could walk into a room and instantly sense the vibe. Made everyone feel heard. People would go above and beyond for him.


That’s leadership, right there. Makes you wonder why we don’t teach emotional intelligence in schools more actively.


Totally. We spend years learning how to solve math problems, but not how to deal with a difficult conversation or recognize when we’re projecting our own insecurities onto someone else.


It’s kind of tragic. And I think that ties back into environment shaping behaviour. If you grow up in a place where vulnerability is punished—like showing emotions is seen as weakness—then you’ll build all these defense mechanisms without realizing it.


Yeah. And then you carry that into adulthood, and it shows up in your relationships, in work, in how you see yourself.


I’ve been trying to pay more attention to those patterns lately. Like when I get irrationally defensive, that’s usually a sign that something deeper is being triggered.


Same. That moment of awareness is so powerful, though. Like hitting pause before reacting.


Exactly. But it’s hard, right? Because our brains are wired for shortcuts—heuristics, biases, whatever you want to call them. Like confirmation bias—we only really see what we want to see.


Or the fundamental attribution error. Like when someone cuts us off in traffic, we think they're a jerk. But if we do it, it's because we're in a rush or had a bad day.


Totally. We judge others by their actions but ourselves by our intentions.


Right! And that creates so much misunderstanding. I honestly think if people just paused to ask, “What else could be going on here?”—the world would be a kinder place.


That takes humility, though. And a bit of discomfort. It's easier to label someone than to entertain the idea that their behaviour is shaped by factors we don’t see.


Absolutely. But here's a curveball—do you think we give too much credit to environment sometimes? Like, where’s the line between context and personal responsibility?


Hmm. That’s a good question. I mean, yeah, context matters a lot, but people also have agency. You can’t just blame your childhood or society forever.


Exactly. I had a friend who always chalked up his anger issues to his “upbringing,” but never did the work to change. At some point, you’ve got to take ownership.


Yeah, it’s like… awareness is step one, but action is step two. Without action, self-awareness becomes just another excuse.


Well said. And I think that’s where emotional intelligence loops back in—because once you notice a pattern, you can choose to respond differently. Even if it’s uncomfortable.


Yeah. Like when you’re aware that you tend to shut down during conflict, but instead you say, “Hey, this is hard for me, but I want to stay in the conversation.” That’s growth.


That’s huge. It reminds me of Carol Dweck’s idea of the growth mindset—believing that behaviours and traits aren’t fixed, but can be developed over time.


Love that. It’s so empowering. Like yeah, maybe I have a tendency to avoid confrontation, but I can learn to face it more constructively.


Totally. And the people who can do that—who are willing to sit with discomfort and unlearn stuff—they’re the ones who evolve the most.


For sure. But it’s a lifelong process, right? No one’s got it all figured out.


Nope. We're all just walking contradictions. Trying to be better. Screwing up. Learning. Trying again.


Exactly. I think the goal isn’t to be perfect—it’s just to be more conscious. More curious about your own behaviour, and less reactive.


And maybe a bit more compassionate toward others too. Like, most people are just doing their best with what they’ve been given.


Yeah. That realization alone can change how you move through the world.


Totally. So—what bias do you think you struggle with the most?


Hmm. Probably negativity bias. I tend to fixate on what’s wrong more than what’s working.


Oh man, same. I could get ten compliments and one criticism and I’ll ruminate on the one bad thing for days.


It's so human, though. I mean, evolution wired us that way to stay safe—but in modern life, it's more of a burden than a benefit.


True. But knowing it helps. Like, I’ve started a habit of writing down three good things at the end of the day. Forces my brain to shift focus.


That’s actually brilliant. I might steal that.


Please do. Little rituals like that—they can reshape how you see yourself, and the world.


And that’s the power of human behaviour, right? We’re not robots. We can change. Slowly, imperfectly, but we can.


Couldn’t agree more. Alright—refill on coffee?


Definitely. I feel like we just solved human nature in one conversation.


laughs Or at least scratched the surface.
