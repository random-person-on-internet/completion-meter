"The Mirror We Walk Around With"

Good evening everyone,

Let me start with a question.

Have you ever looked at someone—maybe in a café, on a street corner, or across the aisle in a grocery store—and thought, “What are they going through?” Not what they do. Not who they love or what they buy or how they dress. But what storms are silently raging behind their eyes?

Human behavior. That’s our topic today. Three simple syllables that contain the most mysterious, beautiful, and sometimes heartbreaking truths about who we are.

Now, I’m not a psychologist. I don’t have a PhD. But I do have a front-row seat to this strange, unpredictable theatre of human behavior—because I am one of you. A human being trying to make sense of other human beings. I stumble, I learn, I observe. And the more I observe, the more I realize something deeply moving:

Every action—every smile, every silence, every outburst—is a story in disguise. And behind each story is something deeply human: a need to be understood, a fear of being alone, a desire to matter.

I. We Are Not What We Seem
Let me tell you a story.

A few years ago, I had a colleague named Michael. He was the guy who always showed up five minutes early. Ironed shirts, polished shoes, perfect posture. Polite, but distant. We all thought he was just “one of those guys.” You know—the efficient, emotionless type who has his life figured out.

Then, one afternoon, he didn’t show up for work. One day turned into two. And on the third day, we got the news: Michael had taken his own life.

It felt like a gut punch. How could this happen? How did we miss it?

And the truth is—we didn’t miss it because it wasn’t there. We missed it because we weren’t looking. We saw his behavior and assumed it told the whole story. But behavior is a mask sometimes. Sometimes it’s a scream dressed as silence.

Michael taught me something I will never forget: People don’t wear signs. They wear smiles. They wear routine. They wear distraction.

So the next time someone cuts you off in traffic or snaps at the coffee shop, pause for a second. Maybe they're just a jerk… but maybe, just maybe, they're Michael.

II. Kindness Is Rare Because It’s Brave
Human behavior isn't always dark. Sometimes it’s breathtakingly beautiful.

Have you ever watched a stranger help an elderly person across the street? Or seen someone pay for another person’s meal, quietly, without fanfare? We love those stories because they remind us of who we could be.

But I’ll be honest—kindness is rare. Not because people are bad. But because people are afraid.

It’s scary to reach out. It’s scary to be the first one to care.

Years ago, when I was going through a rough time—grieving the loss of someone I loved—I kept it to myself. I smiled. I joked. I went to work. But inside, I was numb. Until one day, a friend—not a close one, just a regular lunch buddy—asked me if I was okay.

Not in passing. Not like “Hey, you good?” but really asked. He sat down, looked me in the eye, and said, “You’ve been quiet lately. And I just want to know—do you want to talk?”

That moment broke me open. And it saved me. Because someone chose to care more about connection than comfort. Someone chose to lean in when it was easier to walk away.

We say human behavior is selfish. But I don’t think that’s quite right. I think it’s cautious. And sometimes, kindness is the bravest choice a human can make.

III. We Repeat What We Don’t Repair
Here’s something difficult. And sad. And true.

People hurt people. Not always on purpose. But we do. We carry pain, and that pain becomes patterns. We lash out. We withdraw. We ghost. We yell. We lie. And a lot of the time, we don’t even know why we do it.

Have you ever found yourself reacting to something way out of proportion to what happened? Like snapping at someone because they reminded you—subconsciously—of someone else who hurt you?

We repeat what we don’t repair.

There’s a story that’s always stayed with me—about a man named Derek who grew up in a household where anger was the language of love. If someone yelled at you, it meant they cared. If they were silent, it meant they didn’t.

So guess how Derek turned out?

He got married. And anytime his wife brought up an issue, he exploded. Not because he didn’t love her. But because he’d learned, as a child, that love sounds like shouting.

Now, Derek isn’t real. But he is. Because we all know a Derek. Or we are Derek.

Human behavior is often a map of our past. And if we want to change where we’re going, we have to be brave enough to look at where we’ve been.

That’s hard work. It means going to therapy. It means crying in the car. It means forgiving someone who never said sorry. But it's the only way to stop bleeding on people who didn’t cut us.

IV. The Sadness We Share
Let’s talk about sadness for a moment—not as something to avoid, but as something that connects us.

Sadness is the great equalizer. You don’t have to speak the same language or grow up in the same country to recognize the look in someone’s eyes when they’ve lost something. A loved one. A dream. A version of themselves they thought they’d be by now.

There’s this incredible line by Haruki Murakami. He said:

“No matter how far you travel, you can never get away from yourself.”

Isn’t that true? We carry our heartbreaks like invisible luggage. But what’s interesting is that the people we connect with most… are the ones who let us see their baggage.

Not the people who are always happy. Not the ones who “have it all together.” But the ones who’ve been broken, and rebuilt, and are still a little wobbly—but walking anyway.

Sadness is not weakness. It is proof that we’ve cared. And when we share it, it becomes something else entirely: it becomes connection.

So don’t be afraid to cry in front of someone. Don’t be afraid to say, “I’m not okay.” You’re not a burden. You’re a mirror. And sometimes, that’s all someone else needs—to see that they’re not alone.

V. The Mirror We Walk Around With
If I could leave you with one idea tonight, it’s this:

Each of us walks around carrying a mirror. Every time we speak, every time we act, we reflect something back into the world.

So the question is—what are we reflecting?

Are we reflecting judgment? Or understanding?

Indifference? Or compassion?

Fear? Or love?

The truth is, most people aren’t looking for someone perfect. They’re just looking for someone real. Someone honest. Someone who won’t flinch when the mask slips.

Because behind all the behavior—good, bad, confusing—is a human being trying their best. And if we can remember that, even for a moment, we might treat each other—and ourselves—a little differently.

Closing: The Call to Notice
Let me end with this.

Somewhere in your life, right now, is someone hiding in plain sight. Someone who’s hurting. Someone who’s lonely. Someone who’s exhausted from pretending.

Will you notice them?

Will you ask the question?

Will you slow down long enough to hear the answer?

Because that, my friends, is the power of human behavior—not just to harm or to help, but to heal.

So be the interruption to someone’s loneliness. Be the proof that kindness exists. Be the mirror that shows people their goodness, even when they can’t see it themselves.

Because the world doesn’t need more perfect people.

It needs more human ones.

Thank you.
