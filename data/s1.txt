Why We Do What We Do: A Journey into Human Behaviour

Good evening, everyone.

Let me start with a question—and be honest: Have you ever opened the fridge, stared inside for a full minute, then closed it… without taking anything?

Yeah. Me too.

Now, I don’t know if we’re hoping a block of chocolate will magically appear behind the broccoli, or if we’re just hoping for a reason to exist, but that moment—that quiet, weird little moment—is a perfect example of something deeply human.

We are walking contradictions.

We crave connection, and yet sometimes we ghost the group chat.
We want to be healthy, but give us one slice of pizza and suddenly the diet starts “next Monday.”
We make New Year’s resolutions in fireworks and abandon them by February.
Why? Because human behaviour isn’t logical—it’s emotional. It’s messy. It’s beautiful.

Tonight, I want to take you on a little journey through the maze of human behaviour. We’ll explore what makes us tick, what makes us slip, and what, ultimately, makes us… us.

Here’s my thesis: Human behaviour is shaped more by emotion, environment, and story than by logic.
And understanding this—not just in others, but in ourselves—can make us more compassionate, more grounded, and maybe even a little wiser.

Let’s break it down.


You ever try to convince a toddler that broccoli is better than ice cream?
Yeah. Good luck.

But here’s the thing: we like to think we grow out of that emotional impulsiveness. We don’t. We just get better at justifying it.

Let me tell you a quick story.

A friend of mine—let’s call him Mike—once impulse-bought a \$1,200 espresso machine after watching one YouTube video titled “Why real coffee drinkers never use pods.” The next day he texted me: “I don’t even drink that much coffee.”

Why did he do it?

Not because it was logical. Not because he did the math.
But because in that moment, he felt something: excitement, identity, maybe a little guilt over how many times he’d said “Let’s catch up over coffee” and never did. That one video made him feel like becoming a better version of himself—and the machine was the symbol.

Human behaviour is not a math problem—it’s a story we tell ourselves.

And marketers know this. Politicians know this. The best teachers, leaders, and storytellers all know: If you want to move people, speak to their hearts before their heads.

Even in relationships—when we fight, when we love, when we forgive—it’s never just about who’s “right.” It’s about how we feel: heard, seen, disrespected, appreciated. Emotion is the steering wheel; logic is just the backseat driver.


Now let me ask you another question: Have you ever behaved differently just because of the room you were in?

I once read about an experiment called the “Good Samaritan Study” done in the 1970s at Princeton. Theology students were asked to prepare a talk—some were told to speak about the parable of the Good Samaritan. On their way to the talk, they encountered a man slumped over, clearly in need of help.

Now, you’d think—these are theology students. Talking about helping others. They’d stop, right?

Well… only some did. The biggest predictor of whether they helped wasn’t their values. It wasn’t their personality. It was whether they were in a hurry. If they were told they were late—they stepped over the man. If they had time, they stopped.

It wasn’t their beliefs. It was their context.

And this isn’t just theory. Think about your own life. You behave differently at a wedding than at a job interview. You talk differently with your friends than with your parents. Even what you wear changes how you act.

Ever notice how putting on gym clothes suddenly makes you feel like a fitness god, even if you just end up walking to the kitchen?

That’s the power of environment.

We’re not just products of our choices—we’re products of our surroundings.

So when you want to change a habit or a behaviour, don’t just ask: What do I need to do?
Ask: What’s around me that’s making this hard—or easy?

Want to eat healthier? Put fruit in plain sight.
Want to read more? Put your phone in another room.
Want to be kinder? Surround yourself with people who model kindness.

Because sometimes, the biggest changes come not from “trying harder,” but from “designing better.”


Let me take you back to a moment that changed the way I see people.

Years ago, I was on a packed subway train. You know the scene: headphones in, everyone avoiding eye contact, silently pretending we’re not squished together like sardines. Then—this guy gets on. Middle-aged, wild hair, muttering to himself. He steps on someone’s foot, doesn’t say sorry, then starts ranting about “the government” and “mind control.”

And my first thought, if I’m honest? “Ugh. This guy’s nuts.”

But then something strange happened. Another passenger—an older woman—leaned in and gently asked, “Are you okay? Do you need help?”

The man paused. Took a breath. And quietly said, “I just left the hospital. My wife passed away this morning. I don’t really know where to go.”

The train went silent.

In a single sentence, he went from “crazy stranger” to “grieving husband.” From annoyance… to empathy.

That’s the power of story.

Human behaviour often doesn’t make sense until we know the story behind it. And we all carry stories—stories of loss, love, fear, pride, survival.

So much of our judgment, our impatience, even our anger, comes from assuming we know someone’s story… when we don’t.

But when we’re willing to look a little deeper, ask a little more, listen a little longer—we start to understand not just what people do, but why.

And that shift—from judgment to curiosity—is where compassion lives.


So… what do we do with all of this?

If emotion drives us, if environment shapes us, and if story explains us—then maybe the most powerful thing we can do… is pause.

Pause before judging.
Pause before reacting.
Pause before assuming we understand someone—or even ourselves.

Because we’re all complex. We’re all works-in-progress. And we’re all capable of both incredible kindness and frustrating inconsistency.

I’ve seen the quietest people become heroes in a crisis.
I’ve seen the angriest people soften with a single apology.
I’ve seen people change—really change—not because they were “forced to,” but because someone believed they could.

Human behaviour isn’t fixed. It’s fluid. It bends and breaks and heals. And yes, sometimes it repeats—but sometimes, it grows.


So let me leave you with this:

The next time you catch yourself doing something baffling—like opening the fridge five times for no reason—laugh. Be curious. You’re human.

The next time someone cuts you off in traffic, or snaps at you in line—pause. Maybe they’re carrying a story you can’t see.

And the next time you want to change something in your life—not just a habit, but a pattern—don’t just rely on willpower. Build better surroundings. Tell a better story. And treat yourself with the kind of grace you’d give a friend.

Because at the end of the day, human behaviour is not a puzzle to solve—it’s a dance to join.

We are emotional, unpredictable, beautifully imperfect beings… trying to make sense of ourselves and each other.

And maybe—just maybe—that’s what makes us so worth understanding.

Thank you.
