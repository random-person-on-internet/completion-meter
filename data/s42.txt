Maya: So, I was reading this article last night about how much of our adult behavior is shaped by childhood experiences. It’s wild how much of who we are is just... conditioning.

Jordan: Oh yeah, totally. I think about that all the time—like how our environment wires us before we even know what’s happening. Especially emotionally. You ever notice how some people just can’t deal with conflict, and you find out later they grew up in a house where disagreements were explosive?

Maya: Yes! That’s the thing. It’s like our brains go, “Okay, got it—conflict equals danger,” and that script just runs in the background forever unless we consciously rewrite it.

Jordan: And rewriting it is hard. I mean, emotional intelligence isn’t something you’re born with. It’s taught—or not taught, honestly.

Maya: Exactly. And I think the problem is a lot of adults are still reacting to the world with a five-year-old’s logic. Like, if you were constantly seeking approval as a kid, you might grow up and still bend over backwards for validation—even if it burns you out.

Jordan: Oh, totally. People-pleasers are usually made, not born. My therapist once said, “You adapted to survive. Now you have to learn to live.” That hit me like a brick.

Maya: Wow. Yeah, that’s deep. It's also a little sad—how much of our personality isn’t actually us, it’s just survival mechanisms we picked up early on.

Jordan: But here's the thing—I don’t know if it's always a bad thing. I mean, sometimes those early experiences shape strengths too, right? Like resilience or empathy.

Maya: True. Like kids who grew up in unpredictable homes often become really good at reading people. Hyper-aware of moods, right?

Jordan: Right. Emotional radar turned up to eleven. But then that can also turn into anxiety, overthinking... it’s a double-edged sword.

Maya: Yeah. I guess it depends on how much you’re aware of it. Like, if you know your empathy is a coping mechanism, maybe you can learn to manage it instead of letting it rule you.

Jordan: That’s where self-awareness comes in. Which brings me back to emotional intelligence—it’s not just knowing your emotions, it’s understanding why they’re there.

Maya: And not judging yourself for them. That’s a big one. So many people feel shame for how they react to things, but if you trace it back, it usually makes perfect sense.

Jordan: Totally. Like, “Why do I freeze up in meetings?” Oh, because your opinion was constantly dismissed growing up. It’s not that you’re incompetent—it’s conditioning.

Maya: Speaking of conditioning, have you read anything by Gabor Maté? He talks a lot about how trauma isn’t just what happened to you, it’s how your nervous system responded. Super interesting.

Jordan: Oh, yeah, I’ve seen some of his talks. He connects so many dots—addiction, chronic illness, personality traits—all back to early emotional suppression.

Maya: It’s eye-opening. Makes you realize how much society rewards behavior that’s actually kind of unhealthy, like being a workaholic or emotionally detached.

Jordan: Yep. And let’s not forget cognitive biases. They play into all this too. Like, if you grew up believing you weren’t good enough, your brain starts looking for evidence to confirm that. Even when it’s not true.

Maya: Confirmation bias, right? It’s like your brain becomes your own worst PR manager.

Jordan: (laughs) Exactly. It’s frustrating. You can be doing great, but your brain’s like, “Nah, let’s focus on this one thing that went wrong.”

Maya: And that’s where environment matters. Like, if you surround yourself with people who reinforce that negative narrative, good luck breaking out of it.

Jordan: But then again, people say, “Just change your environment,” like that’s easy. It’s not always possible. Especially if the toxic environment is your family.

Maya: Ugh, I know. That’s the trap. People say things like, “Cut them off,” but that’s a huge emotional decision. Especially when the same people who hurt you are also the ones who raised you.

Jordan: Right. And sometimes they’re not even aware of the damage they did. Generational stuff gets passed down like heirlooms.

Maya: Emotional heirlooms. Yikes. That’s a good term though. I’m gonna use that.

Jordan: (laughs) Be my guest. But seriously, it's fascinating how things like emotional availability or even the ability to name emotions—those skills aren’t universal. Some people never learned them.

Maya: It’s like emotional literacy. If you never got the vocabulary, you can’t describe what you feel. So you either shut down or lash out.

Jordan: Exactly. And if you weren’t encouraged to explore your emotions safely, you probably end up either suppressing them or projecting them.

Maya: And then we call those people “cold” or “dramatic,” when really, they just weren’t taught how to regulate or express themselves.

Jordan: It's why I think schools should teach emotional intelligence alongside math and science. Like, teach kids how to deal with rejection, how to identify anxiety, how to listen without judgment.

Maya: Yes! I always say that. But for some reason, we treat emotions like they’re private problems, not universal experiences.

Jordan: And then we grow up thinking we’re broken for feeling things. When really, we just weren’t shown how to process them.

Maya: Or even that it’s okay to feel them. I remember being told to “calm down” or “stop crying” so many times. Like, what does that teach you? That emotions are bad?

Jordan: Exactly. And it trains you to perform instead of feel. Like, “What’s the acceptable response here?” instead of, “What am I actually experiencing?”

Maya: That’s probably why so many people struggle with authenticity. We’re used to being palatable, not real.

Jordan: Yeah. And then we wonder why we feel disconnected—even from ourselves.

Maya: It’s all linked. Childhood, society, culture... I don’t think we give enough credit to how much of our behavior is learned, not chosen.

Jordan: No kidding. But the good news is, once you do recognize that, you can start unlearning. Takes time, but it’s possible.

Maya: For sure. I think that’s where therapy, journaling, mindfulness—all that comes in. Tools to rewire the stuff we didn’t ask for.

Jordan: Or even just honest conversations like this. That’s healing too.

Maya: Definitely. It’s like putting puzzle pieces together out loud.

Jordan: And realizing, “Oh wait, maybe I’m not broken. Maybe I was just programmed.”

Maya: Exactly. And if it’s programming, then maybe we can rewrite the code.

Jordan: One bug fix at a time.

Maya: (laughs) Now you’re speaking my language.
