“Why Are We Like This? A Deeply Unscientific (But Very True) Look at Human Behaviour”

Let me ask you something. Have you ever opened the fridge, stared at its contents for a full minute, closed it... and then opened it again two minutes later like maybe, just maybe, a slice of cake had magically appeared?

Yeah. Me too.

That, my friends, is human behaviour in a nutshell—equal parts hope, confusion, and mild snacks.

We are strange creatures. Beautiful, brilliant, deeply weird creatures. And tonight, I want to take a little walk through that weirdness with you. Not from the perspective of a psychologist or a neuroscientist—no, no, no. I’m not that responsible. I come to you as a fellow human, confused and amazed by all the delightful nonsense we get up to.

[Thesis – Clear Purpose]

Because human behaviour, in all its chaos, tells a story. It tells us who we are, what we value, what makes us laugh, what makes us cry—and what makes us pretend we didn’t just wave back at someone who wasn’t waving at us.

And if we can understand even a little bit of that story, maybe we can be a bit more forgiving of ourselves... and each other.

So tonight, I want to look at three totally relatable, slightly ridiculous, and extremely human behaviours. Along the way, we’ll laugh, reflect, and probably relive some embarrassing moments. You’re welcome.

[Point One: The Illogical Logic of Our Daily Decisions]

Let’s start with the bizarre way we make decisions.

Now, humans like to think we’re logical. We’re the species that invented math, philosophy, IKEA. But we’re also the species that will spend six hours choosing a new Netflix show—and then just rewatch The Office.

And don’t even get me started on online shopping. We’ll abandon a $4 cart because of a $2.99 shipping fee, but spend $75 to get free shipping. “Oh, look, I saved money!” No, Janet. You bought a Himalayan scented candle, a mug shaped like a llama, and a book you’ll never read.

But here’s the thing—our behaviour doesn’t always have to make sense. Sometimes it’s driven by emotion, habit, or that mysterious voice in your head that says, “Yes, you do need another pair of novelty socks with tacos on them.”

And you know what? That’s okay. The point isn’t to always be rational. The point is to notice when we’re not—and laugh about it.

Like the time I made a pros-and-cons list for whether or not I should text my ex... and then ignored it completely because, and I quote, “Mercury is in retrograde.” (Spoiler: Mercury didn’t send that text. I did. Mercury just watched and judged.)

[Point Two: The Wild World of Social Behaviour]

Now let’s talk about how we behave around each other—the social rituals, the unspoken rules, the sheer drama of being human in public.

Take small talk, for example. It's an Olympic sport. There’s nothing quite like bumping into an acquaintance and pretending neither of you sees the other for a solid 30 seconds before one of you finally says, “Heyyy... how’s it going?” And the other responds with, “Good! Busy! You?” “Same! So busy!” Are we all okay?

And group chats. Oh, the politics of the group chat. You leave for three hours, come back to 197 messages, and somehow still feel like you missed the main point. Also, who added Derek? No one knows a Derek.

And let’s not forget our obsession with being polite. Humans will do anything to avoid conflict. I once watched a guy eat an entire salad with a dessert fork at a wedding because he didn’t want to ask for the right one. That’s not dinner. That’s a hostage situation.

But here’s the lovely part: all these weird behaviours come from a good place. A desire to belong. To connect. To not be that person who ruins the vibe.

So yes, we sometimes behave like socially awkward penguins. But we’re trying. We’re really, really trying.

[Point Three: The Contradictions That Make Us Human]

Finally, let’s talk about the contradictions.

Human behaviour is full of them. We want to be unique, but we don’t want to stand out. We crave adventure... but also Wi-Fi. We say we hate drama—and then binge-watch six seasons of it in a weekend.

We’re walking contradictions. And that’s not a flaw—it’s kind of magical.

Take fear and bravery, for example. You can be terrified of public speaking and still get up here and do it. (Hi, yes, that’s me.) You can want love more than anything and still run screaming when someone says, “I think we should talk.”

And let’s not forget: we are the only species that will create entire social structures around who gets to sit where in the office kitchen. Or who owes whom a coffee because of that one time in January when someone covered a shift. We keep score like it’s a professional sport.

And yet—we also build friendships over coffee, fall in love over memes, and comfort strangers in comment sections. We are contradictory, messy, generous, petty, magnificent creatures.

[A Funny but True Story – To Tie It All Together]

Let me tell you a quick story that sums all of this up.

Last year, I was in a supermarket. I saw a guy drop a jar of pasta sauce. It shattered. Red sauce everywhere. He looked around, panicked, and then did something I will never forget.

He pulled out his phone... and took a photo.

Not to post. Not to get help. No—he told the manager, “My friend needs to see this. He’ll love it.”

And I thought—yes. That’s it. That’s human behaviour right there. A moment of mess, turned into a moment of connection. Disaster, repurposed as comedy. That’s us.

[Conclusion – Tie It All Together, Call to Thought/Action]

So what does all this mean?

It means human behaviour isn’t something to “solve” or “fix.” It’s something to observe, laugh at, and—most importantly—accept.

We are all figuring it out. Every single one of us. We are messy and glorious, awkward and wise, ridiculous and wonderful.

So next time you make a weird decision, or say something awkward, or lie awake at 3 a.m. remembering that time in 2014 when you called your teacher “mom”—just smile.

You’re not broken. You’re just human. And honestly? That’s kind of amazing.

Let’s keep being kind to each other. Let’s keep laughing at ourselves. And above all... let’s keep checking the fridge. You never know. One day, that cake might be there.

Thank you.
