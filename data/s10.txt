Understanding Human Behavior: The Hidden Forces That Shape Us

Good morning, everyone.

It's a real pleasure to be here today among so many people who are curious—not just about what we do as humans, but why we do it. Human behavior is one of the most fascinating puzzles we can study because, at the end of the day, we’re all part of the experiment.

We laugh, we cry, we overthink text messages, and we sometimes eat ice cream at 2 a.m. even though we promised ourselves we wouldn’t. Why? What drives those actions, and how much of our behavior is truly ours?

Today, I want to unpack three key forces that shape our behavior: emotional intelligence, social conditioning, and cognitive bias. Together, these form a kind of invisible architecture that guides much of how we think, act, and interact—often without us realizing it.

[Theme 1: Emotional Intelligence – The GPS of Human Interaction]

Let’s start with emotional intelligence.

Coined by psychologist Daniel Goleman in the 1990s, emotional intelligence—or EQ—is our ability to recognize, understand, and manage our own emotions, as well as the emotions of others. Think of it as the GPS for navigating social situations.

Most of us like to believe we’re rational creatures. But if we’re honest, our emotions are often in the driver’s seat. You don’t yell at your spouse because you’ve calculated it’s the most effective communication strategy. You do it because you’re hurt, frustrated, or overwhelmed.

EQ has five key components: self-awareness, self-regulation, motivation, empathy, and social skills. And the research is clear: people with high EQs tend to have stronger relationships, better mental health, and even higher job performance.

One powerful example is in conflict resolution. A manager with high EQ doesn’t just fire off an email when things go wrong. They pause, consider how their words will be received, and address the issue constructively. That pause—small as it is—is often the difference between escalation and resolution.

EQ isn’t just about being “nice” or “calm”—it’s about emotional literacy. And like any literacy, it can be learned and refined.

[Theme 2: Social Conditioning – The Culture Code Within Us]

Next, let’s talk about social conditioning.

This is the process by which we absorb the values, norms, and expectations of the society we grow up in. It begins before we can speak and continues long after we think we’re done learning.

If you were raised in a culture that values independence, like the U.S., you probably see “asking for help” as a sign of weakness. But if you were raised in a collectivist culture, like Japan, not asking for help might be seen as selfish.

Social conditioning shapes everything from how we define success to how we interpret facial expressions. It’s the software running in the background of our minds.

Take something as simple as shaking hands. In some cultures, it's a sign of respect. In others, it might be considered invasive. The action is the same—but the meaning is entirely conditioned.

Now, the challenge is that we often confuse social norms with truths. We believe that “real men don’t cry” or “women are more nurturing” because these messages are embedded in our cultural frameworks. But these aren’t biological facts—they’re conditioned beliefs.

The more aware we become of our cultural programming, the more agency we gain over our choices. In a way, understanding social conditioning is like learning how to read the matrix.

[Theme 3: Cognitive Bias – The Brain’s Shortcuts and Slip-Ups]

And finally, let’s talk about cognitive bias.

Our brains are magnificent, but they’re not perfect. In order to process the overwhelming amount of information we encounter every day, the brain relies on shortcuts—called heuristics. Most of the time, these help us make quick decisions. But sometimes, they lead us astray.

A classic example is the confirmation bias—our tendency to seek out information that confirms what we already believe and ignore what contradicts it. This is why political debates on social media rarely lead to changed minds. People aren’t engaging to learn; they’re engaging to reinforce their own views.

Another common bias is the availability heuristic—judging the probability of an event based on how easily we can recall an example. After watching the news, people often overestimate the likelihood of dramatic but rare events—like plane crashes or shark attacks—because those images are vivid and emotionally charged.

These biases aren’t signs of stupidity; they’re byproducts of evolutionary survival mechanisms. But in the modern world, where complexity abounds, they can lead us to poor decisions, flawed judgments, and persistent misunderstandings.

The key is not to eliminate bias—that’s impossible—but to become aware of it. Just like you can’t remove gravity, but you can learn how to work with it.

[Conclusion: Turning Insight Into Action]

So where does this leave us?

If emotional intelligence is how we navigate emotions, social conditioning is the map we inherit, and cognitive bias is the lens through which we see the world—then understanding human behavior means learning to navigate with flawed tools, on a shifting map, while wearing tinted glasses.

But the good news is: we can improve our tools.

We can build emotional intelligence by practicing mindfulness, empathy, and communication. We can question social norms and choose which ones serve us. And we can learn about our biases—not to shame ourselves, but to better understand the patterns behind our decisions.

Ultimately, the goal isn’t perfection. It’s awareness.

Because with awareness comes choice. And with choice comes the power to change—not just ourselves, but how we relate to others, and how we shape the culture around us.

So as you leave here today, I encourage you to ask yourself: What part of my behavior is truly mine? And what part is on autopilot?

Once you start asking that question, you’ve already begun the work.

Thank you.
