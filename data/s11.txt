Why We Do What We Do: Understanding Human Behaviour from the Inside Out

Good morning everyone,

It’s a real pleasure to be here with you today. Whether you’re a psychologist, a coach, a student of human nature, or simply someone trying to better understand yourself and others — you’re in the right place. Because today, we're going to take a deep dive into what drives human behaviour. Not in a vague, philosophical way — but grounded in psychology, neuroscience, and the messy, fascinating reality of everyday life.

Let me start with a simple but powerful question: Why do we do what we do?

It’s a question that haunts every parent, every leader, every teacher — and, frankly, every one of us who’s ever made a New Year’s resolution and broken it by February. Why do we act against our own interests? Why do we repeat the same patterns? Why do we sometimes know better, but don’t do better?

To begin answering this, we’ll explore three key forces that shape our behaviour: emotional intelligence, social conditioning, and cognitive bias.

1. Emotional Intelligence: The Invisible Driver
Let’s start with emotional intelligence — or as I like to call it, the operating system we didn’t know we needed an update for.

Emotional intelligence, or EQ, is our ability to recognize, understand, and manage our own emotions — and to recognize, understand, and influence the emotions of others. While IQ might get you through school, it’s EQ that gets you through life.

You see, we often assume that humans are rational beings who sometimes feel. In reality, we are emotional beings who sometimes think.

Take the amygdala, the almond-shaped structure in our brain’s limbic system. It’s designed to detect threats — real or imagined — and trigger fight, flight, or freeze responses. The problem is, it doesn’t distinguish well between a lion in the savannah and a critical email from your boss. Both can cause a surge of cortisol and adrenaline, priming us for reactivity rather than reason.

This is where EQ comes in. It’s not about suppressing emotions — it’s about creating enough space between stimulus and response to choose a better action.

Want a practical example? Think about road rage. Someone cuts you off, and your first impulse is to lay on the horn or shout an insult. But what if you could take a breath, check your emotional dashboard, and ask, “Is this worth my peace?” That’s emotional intelligence at work. It’s not sexy. It’s not flashy. But it’s transformational.

2. Social Conditioning: The Scripts We Didn’t Write
Now let’s talk about social conditioning — the invisible scripts we follow because we were never told we could rewrite them.

From the moment we’re born, we’re absorbing cues from the world around us — from our families, cultures, media, religion, and peers. These cues become unconscious rules: “Success looks like this.” “Real men don’t cry.” “People like me don’t go to college.” These aren’t truths; they’re templates.

One of the most famous examples of this is the “Stanford Prison Experiment.” In 1971, psychologist Philip Zimbardo put college students in a simulated prison, randomly assigning them the roles of guards and prisoners. Within days, the guards began to exhibit authoritarian, even abusive behaviour — simply because the role gave them implicit permission. The experiment had to be shut down early.

This wasn’t about bad apples. It was about the power of the barrel.

We act not just based on who we are, but on who we think we’re supposed to be.

Social conditioning is also why we often follow the herd. There’s a term for this: normative social influence — our tendency to conform in order to be liked or accepted, even if it goes against our better judgment.

Ever laughed at a joke you didn’t find funny, just because everyone else did? That’s not weakness — that’s wiring. But once we see it, we can choose differently.

3. Cognitive Bias: The Brain’s Mental Shortcuts (and Pitfalls)
Finally, let’s look at cognitive biases — those sneaky mental shortcuts our brains take to save time and effort, often at the cost of accuracy.

Your brain is a prediction machine. It uses past experiences to interpret the present and anticipate the future. But in doing so, it often distorts reality.

Consider confirmation bias — our tendency to seek out and favor information that confirms what we already believe. It’s why someone who believes vaccines are harmful can find an obscure blog post and treat it as gospel, ignoring dozens of peer-reviewed studies. It’s not stupidity — it’s the brain trying to conserve energy and protect existing worldviews.

Or take the availability heuristic — we overestimate the likelihood of events that are recent or vivid. That’s why people fear plane crashes more than car accidents, even though the latter are far more common. If you just watched a documentary on plane disasters, your brain will flag flying as disproportionately risky.

These biases aren’t flaws — they’re features. But left unchecked, they skew our decisions, relationships, and perceptions of reality.

Conclusion: The Power of Awareness
So, where does all of this leave us?

It leaves us with a simple but powerful truth: human behaviour is not random — it’s patterned, predictable, and most importantly, modifiable.

When we develop emotional intelligence, we gain control over our impulses. When we recognize social conditioning, we begin to question the roles we play. And when we become aware of cognitive biases, we sharpen our judgment and decision-making.

Awareness is the beginning of change. Not willpower. Not shame. Not grit. Awareness.

To quote Viktor Frankl, the psychiatrist and Holocaust survivor: “Between stimulus and response there is a space. In that space is our power to choose our response. In our response lies our growth and our freedom.”

So my challenge to you — whether you’re here to help others grow or to grow yourself — is to get curious. Not just about behaviour, but about the forces behind it. Don’t just ask what people do. Ask why they do it — and how those patterns can be shifted.

Because once we understand behaviour, we stop reacting and start responding. And that, my friends, is where transformation begins.

Thank you.
