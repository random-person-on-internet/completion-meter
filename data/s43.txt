 You know, I’ve been thinking a lot about how much of our adult personality is really just a reflection of our childhood experiences. It’s kind of wild.

 Totally. I read somewhere that by the age of seven, a lot of our core personality traits are already in place. I’m not sure how rigid that is, but it makes sense if you think about how formative those early years are.

 Yeah, like the way we handle conflict or how we express emotions—so much of that comes from what we saw growing up. If your parents didn’t really talk about feelings, chances are you might struggle with emotional expression too.

 Or the opposite! Some people end up swinging the other way—becoming hyper-aware or overcompensating. It’s like a subconscious rebellion.

 True, true. But that’s where emotional intelligence comes in, right? Like, recognizing your patterns and then choosing how to respond instead of just reacting.

 Exactly. But I wonder how much of emotional intelligence is something we learn versus something we’re wired with.

 That’s a good question. I think there’s a baseline temperament we’re born with, but EQ definitely feels more flexible than, say, IQ. I mean, you can teach a kid how to name their emotions and how to handle frustration. That stuff makes a difference.

 Yeah, and schools are starting to catch on. SEL—Social and Emotional Learning—is getting more attention now. We never had that when we were kids.

 Nope. We just had "stop crying" or "go to your room." [laughs]

 Right? And then you grow up thinking that being vulnerable is weak or that you should always keep it together.

 And then wonder why you’re in therapy at 30.

 [laughs] Guilty. But speaking of which, do you think environment trumps genetics when it comes to behavior?

 Hmm... not sure it’s a clear either-or. I think environment can amplify or mute genetic tendencies. Like, a kid might be naturally introverted, but if they grow up in a loud, expressive household, they might learn to navigate social spaces more comfortably.

 Yeah, or the reverse—maybe an extroverted kid becomes more withdrawn in a critical or dismissive environment.

 Exactly. It’s that whole "nature via nurture" idea.

 You know what's interesting? How even subtle stuff conditions us. Like birth order. Or the way adults talk to us when we mess up. Some kids internalize “I made a mistake,” others hear “I am a mistake.”

 That’s a big one. Language really shapes our inner narrative. It’s crazy how those little repeated messages—“you’re so sensitive,” “don’t be dramatic,” “boys don’t cry”—stick with you.

 Especially when you're young and just trying to figure out your place in the world.

 Exactly. And then, later in life, you end up projecting all those insecurities onto people or situations without even realizing it.

 Cognitive biases love that stuff. Like confirmation bias—you start noticing all the things that reinforce your belief that you’re not good enough or that people always let you down.

 Or the fundamental attribution error, where you assume someone else’s bad behavior is because they’re a terrible person, but yours is due to circumstances.

 [grinning] You mean like when someone cuts you off in traffic and they’re a jerk, but when you do it, it’s because you were late to a really important meeting?

 Exactly! [laughs] We’re so good at justifying our own stuff.

 And half the time, it’s not even conscious. I think that's the scary part.

 It is. That’s why doing the work—self-reflection, therapy, mindfulness, whatever—matters so much. You can’t change what you’re not aware of.

 That’s the tough part though. A lot of people never want to look under the hood. It’s uncomfortable.

 Oh yeah. But growth isn’t supposed to be cozy. You’ve got to be willing to unlearn.

 And sometimes that means challenging the very people or systems that shaped you. That’s not easy.

 Especially in families where questioning tradition feels like betrayal.

 Or where emotions are seen as weakness. That’s still a huge cultural block in some places.

 Yup. But I do think there’s hope. Like, I look at younger generations—they’re way more emotionally aware. Talking about mental health, boundaries, even trauma. It’s not perfect, but it’s a shift.

 For sure. I just hope it doesn’t swing too far into self-diagnosis TikTok territory, you know?

 Yeah... there’s a fine line between self-awareness and over-identifying with labels.

 Right. Like, it’s useful to understand your tendencies or trauma responses, but you don’t want to box yourself in. “I’m just an anxious person” can turn into a self-fulfilling prophecy.

 Or an excuse. I think that’s where personal responsibility comes in. Your childhood may explain your behavior, but it doesn’t excuse it forever.

 Totally agree. Awareness is the first step, but action is where change happens.

 And it’s not linear either. You can know better and still mess up sometimes.

 Oh, for sure. Growth is like... spiraling upwards. You revisit the same issues, but from a slightly higher perspective each time.

 I love that. Spiraling upwards. I’ll have to steal that.

 Go ahead. [smiles] So, do you think people can fundamentally change, or are we just slightly refined versions of our childhood selves?

 Hmm. I think we can change, but it takes serious intention. The default is to stay the same. Comfort zone stuff.

 Yeah, our brains love patterns—even if they’re unhealthy.

 But I’ve seen people do it. Like, actually shift how they relate to themselves and others. It’s slow, but possible.

 Me too. I guess that’s kind of encouraging, huh?

 Definitely. It means we’re not doomed to repeat the past. We can write new stories.

 Cheers to that. Rewrite the script, one conscious choice at a time.

 Amen. Now if only our inner seven-year-olds would get the memo.

 [laughs] They're trying, Maya. They just need a little patience.
