Understanding Human Behaviour and Decision Making: The Hidden Forces Shaping Our Choices

Good morning everyone,

It’s a privilege to be here today to talk about something we all experience every single day, yet seldom fully understand: human behaviour and decision making. We make thousands of decisions in our lives — from the mundane, like what to eat for breakfast, to the profound, like choosing a career path or forming relationships. But have you ever stopped to wonder, what really drives those decisions? Why do we sometimes make choices that seem irrational or even against our own best interests?

Today, I want to take you on a journey through some of the fascinating forces behind our behaviour and decision making. We’ll explore three key themes: emotional intelligence, social conditioning, and cognitive biases. By understanding these, we can gain greater insight into ourselves and others—and ultimately make better choices.

1. Emotional Intelligence: The Inner Compass of Decision Making
Let’s start with emotional intelligence, or EI, a term popularized by psychologist Daniel Goleman. At its core, emotional intelligence is our ability to recognize, understand, and manage our own emotions — and to empathize with others’.

Imagine you’re in a stressful situation: maybe a disagreement with a colleague or a tough deadline. Your emotional intelligence influences how you respond. Someone with high EI might recognize their rising frustration and choose to pause, breathe, and respond thoughtfully instead of reacting impulsively.

Why is this important for decision making? Because emotions are often the invisible drivers behind our choices. Neuroscientific studies show that our brain’s emotional centers, like the amygdala, often activate before our logical reasoning kicks in. This means emotions often steer us before our rational mind has a chance to weigh in.

Consider the famous case of Phineas Gage, a 19th-century railroad worker who survived a severe brain injury to his frontal lobes. After the injury, although his intellect remained intact, his personality and decision-making were drastically impaired. This case highlighted the crucial role of emotional processing areas in making sound decisions.

In practical terms, developing emotional intelligence helps us create an “inner compass” that guides us toward decisions aligned with our values, reduces impulsivity, and improves interpersonal relationships. It’s a skill we can cultivate through mindfulness, self-reflection, and empathetic listening.

2. Social Conditioning: The Invisible Hand of Culture and Environment
Now, let’s shift from our internal world to the external forces shaping our decisions: social conditioning.

From the moment we’re born, we’re immersed in a social environment filled with norms, beliefs, and expectations. These shape our perceptions of what’s “right” or “normal.” For example, think about how different cultures approach concepts like time, authority, or success. What might seem perfectly reasonable in one society can feel alien or even wrong in another.

This conditioning affects decision making in subtle ways. It’s why a teenager might conform to peer pressure to fit in, or why adults follow career paths that align with family or societal expectations rather than personal passion.

A great example is the Asch conformity experiments from the 1950s. Participants were shown a simple line comparison task where confederates intentionally gave wrong answers. Shockingly, many participants conformed to the incorrect group consensus, even when it was clearly wrong—just to avoid standing out.

Social conditioning is like the invisible hand guiding many of our choices—sometimes helpful, providing stability and social cohesion; sometimes limiting, suppressing individuality or critical thinking.

The key takeaway? Awareness is power. By recognizing the influence of social conditioning, we can question automatic assumptions and choose whether to follow the crowd or carve our own path.

3. Cognitive Biases: The Mind’s Shortcuts and Pitfalls
Lastly, I want to talk about cognitive biases—those mental shortcuts our brain takes to process information quickly but sometimes at a cost.

The human brain is a remarkable but resource-limited organ. To navigate the vast amount of information we face, it relies on heuristics—rules of thumb. While heuristics can be efficient, they can also lead us astray.

One well-known bias is the confirmation bias: the tendency to seek out and favor information that confirms our pre-existing beliefs while ignoring contradictory evidence. This bias explains why debates can become entrenched and why misinformation spreads so easily.

Another example is the availability heuristic, where we judge the likelihood of events based on how easily examples come to mind. For instance, after hearing about a plane crash on the news, some people might irrationally fear flying more, despite it being statistically safe.

These biases operate largely unconsciously, shaping everything from how we assess risks to whom we trust. But cognitive biases don’t just cause errors; they reflect the brain’s incredible adaptability and efficiency.

What can we do about them? The first step is metacognition—thinking about our thinking. By pausing to reflect and challenge our assumptions, we create space for more deliberate, balanced decisions.

Conclusion: Toward More Conscious Decision Making
To wrap up, human behaviour and decision making are the product of complex, intertwined forces: the emotions that color our perceptions, the social frameworks that shape our beliefs, and the cognitive shortcuts our brains use to make sense of the world.

Understanding emotional intelligence helps us manage our inner experiences with greater clarity and empathy. Recognizing social conditioning allows us to see beyond inherited patterns and choose authenticity. And being aware of cognitive biases equips us to think more critically and avoid common pitfalls.

In a world brimming with choices and information, developing this awareness is more important than ever. It empowers us not just to react to life’s challenges, but to actively shape our paths with intention and wisdom.

Thank you for your attention. I hope these insights serve you well as you navigate your own decisions—and inspire you to keep exploring the fascinating landscape of human behaviour.
